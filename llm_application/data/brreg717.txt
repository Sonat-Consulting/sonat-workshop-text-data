                                Dissolution                            



The basic principle is that the partnership meeting decides that the company is to be dissolved.
Upon the decision of dissolution, the partnership meeting may also elect a liquidation board. If the company has a board or a general manager, they have to step down. The partnership meeting has the option to elect the current board to become the liquidation board.
You must attach

minutes from the partnership meeting showing the decision to dissolve and the election of a liquidation board, if any.

If new board members are elected for the liquidation board, they have to sign the form or they have to enclose a declaration of acceptance where they confirm that they have taken on the assignment.
The Register of Business Enterprises will announce the notification of dissolution. The deadline for the creditors is six weeks from the date it was announced on our web pages.
