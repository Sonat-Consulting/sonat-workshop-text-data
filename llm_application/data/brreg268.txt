About the Aquaculture Register

Last updated: 27 October 2021.






The Aquaculture Register contains an overview of aquaculture licences and some important decisions connected to these. It also contains the officially registered rights on the licences.
This register was established in 2006 and is an assets register. This means that the register is arranged according to the licences. Each licence constitutes a separate entity in the register. The register contains a list of aquaculture licences and some significant management decisions related to these. In addition, the register contains an overview of transfers, mortgages and other rights that are officially registered on the licences.
The register contains a management component and a registration component. The Directorate of Fisheries is responsible for the managing part of the register, including the extradition and registration of the contents of the aquaculture licence (what kind of licence, location, number, etc.). The Brønnøysund Register Centre states and is liable for information relating to the registration component. Registration provides legal protection. The information in the Aquaculture Register is public. That is, everyone can receive information about liens and rights registered in this register.
