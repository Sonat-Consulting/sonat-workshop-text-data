Easier public procurement with eDocumentation

Last updated: 10 November 2022.





eDocumentation is a data sharing service from the Brønnøysund Register Centre that simplifies procurement for all parties in the public sector.

Real-time information directly from the data source
eDocumentation makes information available from various data sources for purchasing managers in the public sector through the client’s tools for competition implementation (KGV). eDocumentation is based upon technical components in Altinn.
The Brønnøysund Register Centre and the Agency for Public and Financial Management (DFØ) have in close collaboration specified the information elements that are included in the eDocuments. They contain both open data and data that requires a consent or authorisation from the individual supplier.
The Brønnøysund Register Centre and the Tax Administration are the data sources used today. We plan to expand with more information elements and data sources.
What are the benefits of eDocumentation?

simplifies the suppliers’ requirements to deliver certificates from the public sector
information directly from the data owner in real-time – cannot be manipulated
makes it easier to develop automatic control routines
always delivers updated information/documentation, also during the contract period
