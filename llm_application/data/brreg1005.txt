The obligation to submit applies even if the enterprise is dormant. If the enterprise does not comply with the deadline, you will receive a late filing penalty, which can amount up to NOK 64,636.
Once the annual accounts have been processed, the enterprise will receive a decision in the Inbox of Altinn, with a notification via e-mail or SMS.
If you have submitted the annual accounts within the deadline, you will have two weeks to correct any errors or insufficiencies without receiving any late filing penalty.
You must send the annual accounts to the Register of Company Accounts, in addition to the tax Return, which you submit to the Tax Administration.
The board, possibly the participants or the general manager, are responsible for sending the annual accounts even if they have agreed that the accountant or auditor will do it.
