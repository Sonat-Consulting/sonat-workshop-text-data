Memorandum of association for a public limited company

Last updated: 16 March 2023.





In order to establish a public limited company, the founders must create a memorandum of association. 

The founders are those who subscribe to shares at the time of the establishment. This might be one or several natural individuals, or legal persons, such as limited companies or general partnerships.
The memorandum of association must at least state

the business name
articles of association
the national ID number/organisation number/the business name and addresses to all the founders
the number of shares to be subscribed by each of the founders
the amount to be paid for each share (share contribution)
the due date for settlement of the share contributions
election of board and auditor

Foreign people who are founders only need to provide their date of birth. If it is a foreign enterprise, you must state the enterpriseâ€™s name and address as well as who represents the founder. When all the founders have dated and signed the memorandum of association, the shares are subscribed and the company is established.
The memorandum of association must include any information

whether the share contribution is to be settled in other assets than cash
if someone is given special rights at the formation
whether the company shall cover the expenses of the formation
