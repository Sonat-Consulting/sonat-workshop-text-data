The information is available to everyone

Last updated: 24 June 2022.





Once your business is registered and has received an organisation number, the information sent to us, is available to everyone.

There are a few exceptions: national identity numbers and d-numbers are only available to credit inquiry agencies, as well as public authorities.
The registration, as well as all changes, about the business, will be announced with us.
Attachments are also public
All attachements you submit, such as minutes of a meeting, memorandum of association and statues, are public, as well. You can strike off information from the minutes of a meeting, as long as it meets the requirements for what the minutes need to contain.
