Increase of the primary capital in public foundations

Last updated: 28 February 2022.





The decision to increase the primary capital is made by the board

The board cannot make such a decision if the increase conflicts the foundation’s objective, the articles of association or the founders preconditions.
The capital increase must be reported to the Foundation Register within six weeks after the decision has been made.
