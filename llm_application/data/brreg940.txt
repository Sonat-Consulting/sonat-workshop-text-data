About EMAS – Eco-Management and Audit Scheme

Last updated: 17 February 2023.





If you wish to register your organisation in the EMAS register, you can do this at the Brønnøysund Register Centre. 

EMAS – Eco-Management and Audit Scheme – is a voluntary scheme for environmental registration of organisations within the EU. The scheme has existed since 1993. Through the EEA agreement, Norwegian organisations can also participate in the scheme.
An EMAS approval means that the organisation complies and goes beyond its environmental performance than what is required by statutory environmental requirements. For Norwegian organisations competing in the European market, there can be a market advantage to be registered in the EMAS register.
 


The Ministry of Climate and Environment has the main responsibility for the EMAS scheme in Norway, with the Norwegian Environment Agency as executive body. Approved environmental verifiers are committed to inspection and supervision of environmental performance in the organisations. The Brønnøysund Register Centre is responsible for the approval and the registration of organisations that will be included in the scheme. This register also updates register information to the EU register.
EMAS is an open register where everyone has access to information about an EMAS registered organisation.
