The Grassroot allotment programme

Last updated: 3 May 2023.





The Grassroot allotment programme allows players at Norsk Tipping to donate part of the stake to a club or an association. 

Registration in the Register of Non-Profit Organisations is a prerequisite for receiving funds through the Grassroot allotment programme.
First, you have to make sure that your club or association is registered in the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities before applying for registration in the Register of Non-Profit Organisations. This can also be done at the same time.
Who can participate in the Grassroot allotment programme?
Only organisations with activity locally or regionally can participate in the Grassroot allotment programme. Thus, associations which are umbrella organisations for local organisations or organisations with activity covering the entire country cannot participate. In addition, the activity must be of a certain type. The limitations are for the most part, but not exclusively, based on the category registered in the Register of Non-Profit Organisations.

                                Which categories give conditional right or no right to participate?                            




2 – Education and Research

Organisations whose activity is solely within the main category education and research cannot participate in the Grassroot allotment programme.

3 – Health

Can participate in the programme, but not organisations which run hospitals, rehabilitation, nursing homes, psychiatric institutions or any kind of private health clinics.

6 – Housing and local community

Cannot participate in the programme. Exceptions apply to residents’ associations where the activity does not benefit private financial interests.

 7 – Political- and Non-governmental organisations(NGO)

Can participate in the programme, but not organisations that make up political parties. Nonetheless, political youth organisations can participate.

11 – Business and professional associations and trade unions

Cannot participate in the programme. Exceptions apply to student organisations, which nevertheless have the right to participate.




There are other limitations to the participation in the Grassroot allotment programme. These are available in the grassroot regulations.
Required account number
If your club or association is going to participate in the Grassroot allotment programme, you have to state the organisation’s account number in the form Coordinated register notification.
If the account number is incorrect, resulting in the payment from Norsk Tipping failing, your club or association will lose its right to receive accrued funds.
Even if the enterprise does not participate in the Grassroot allotment programme, it may choose to register the account number in the Register of Non-Profit Organisations. This makes it easier for those who need it, such as donors, to find the organisation’s account number.
The Grassroot allotment programme is administered by Norsk Tipping
