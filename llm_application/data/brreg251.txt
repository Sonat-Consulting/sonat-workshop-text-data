You fill in and sign the form and you will get the memorandum of association directly in your inbox in Altinn.
You can get help to fill in the form as you proceed and the information will be checked towards the set of rules that apply. The service makes it easier for those who are forming their first limited company and for those who are more experienced. It works just as well whether you are forming your company alone or with others.
When is the company established?
The company is founded when everyone has signed and you receive a feedback in Altinn. The reporter, the founders (the proxy if any) and the auditor receive the notification. The notification contains memorandum of association, articles of association and a statement if any.
Registration in The Register of Business Enterprises
After the company has been founded you need to submit a registration form to The Register of Business Enterprises. Once the company is registered here, it receives an organisation number and a certificate of registration.
The deadline for registration in The Register of Business Enterprises is three months from the date of the foundation of the company.
In order to register your company you need to use the link “Gå til registrering i Foretaksregisteret” which you will find in the feedback in your inbox in Altinn. You will then receive a registration form that is prefilled with information from the memorandum of association. The memorandum of association and the articles of association will be enclosed as attachments.
Service limitations
It is not possible in this version to add agreements between the founders other than those that pursuant to section 2-4 of the Limited Liability Companies Act are to be included in the memorandum of association.
