We will not contact you to sell services, and we will never ask for your credit card number. 

Make sure the web address is correct
There are web addresses that are very similar to ours, so make sure you have entered the correct web page when reporting something with us. Brreg.no is the web address for all our services. Are you going to register something or change information in our registers, you also need to log in through ID-porten with, for example, BankID to gain access to the service.
We will never ask you to confirm any changes
Registrations and changes with us are reported in the form Coordinated register notification. Once you have signed and submitted, you have done what you are supposed to do. We will never ask you to confirm the information in a separate e-mail or text message. Nor will you receive text messages from us asking you to click on any links.
Guidance is free of charge
Someone has experienced that telephone sellers pretend to represent the Brønnøysund Register Centre and offer services for a fee in our name. We will never contact you for the sale of services, or ask for your credit card number. Guidance with us is free of charge!
If you are unsure whether the Brønnøysund Register Centre has contacted you, please contact our customer service.
