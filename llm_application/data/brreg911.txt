Compulsory registration in the Register of Business Enterprises

Last updated: 30 January 2023.





If you run a business, but do not meet the requirements as listed below, you are not obliged to register the sole proprietorship in the Register of Business Enterprises. 

You can still register the enterprise in this register if you prefer. Such registration will, among other things, provide the enterprise with a certificate of registration. The registration entails a fee.
You are obliged to register your sole proprietorship in The Register of Business Enterprises if you

operate resale of purchased goods
are going to operate as a state authorised accountant
are going to operate as a state authorised auditor
have more than five employees who work more than 20 hours per week
are pledging your inventory, motor vehicle or other things where it is provided that the mortgagor is self-employed

All sole proprietorships can register in the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities, and will then receive an organisation number. Registration in the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities is free of charge.
