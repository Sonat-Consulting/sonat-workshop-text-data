How do I choose a name for my enterprise?

Last updated: 11 April 2023.





Here is an overview of what to think about when choosing a name. 

When choosing a name, you need to make sure that the name

contains the correct designation of the organisation type, for example, the name of a limited company must contain the word “aksjeselskap” or AS, and that this is placed in the start or end of the name
does not contain Norwegian organisation types that express anything other than the enterprise’s organisation type.  The word foundation may, for example, not be included in the name of a limited company.
does not contain foreign organisation types, such as AG, GMBH, APS, OY, OYJ, LLP, LTD, PLC, AB, AB PUBL, INC
is not suited to mislead
is not suited to cause offence, such as using swear words
contains at least three letters
is in accordance with the law
is not the name of a land or municipality

A sole proprietorship or a general partnership cannot contain another person’s name other than the name of the owner/partners. The name of a sole proprietorship must contain the surname of the owner.
Is the enterprise registered in the Register of Business Enterprises?
Is the enterprise doing business activities and registered in the Register of Business Enterprises, you need to make sure that the name is not identical to another name registered in the Register of Business Enterprises
 







 
                                Is the name available?                            



It is a good idea to check if the name is available. You can easily do this at namesearch.no. If the name is in use, you must choose another name or obtain a declaration of concent from the enterprise that possess the name.










 
                                Who can choose the name?                            



The name must be decided by an authorised body, such as the general meeting, the partnership meeting or the annual meeting. If the enterprise has articles of association, partnership agreement or shipping agreement, changing the name will imply changes here as well.
You report a new name by submitting Coordinated register notification. You must attach

minutes from an authorised body, such as the general meeting
any updated articles of association/partnership agreement/shipping agreement
any declaration of consent from the licensee in the event of name similarity











 
                                Can I use a different business name than what is registered?                            



When you market your enterprise, you can use a different name for the business than the one registered. You can for example use this name on a sign, as a logo or a domain name.  The officially registered name must still appear on all business documents, such as letters, web pages and invoices.










 
                                Do you have a sub-entity?                            



Enterprises undertaking business activities and have employees, must have a registered sub-entity.
Many people choose another name of the sub-entity, which can be used as a marketing name, as well. Please note that a separate name of sub-entity does not have name protection. If you want name protection of the sub-entity’s name, or a marketing name that is not registered as the name of the sub-entity, you must contact the Norwegian Industrial Property Office.
