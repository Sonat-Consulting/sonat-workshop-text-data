How to fill in the form
 







 
                                1. Business name                            



1.1 The complete name of the enterprise
This field must always be filled in.
Enter the complete business name and organisation number. Upon a new registration, the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities will assign the organisation number.
When reporting change of a registered business name, you need to state the registered business name prior to the change here. The new business name must be entered in field 1.2.
Bear in mind that the business name stated in this field (or in field 1.2 if the notification is about a change), is the name which will be displayed on the certificate of registration from the Register of Business Enterprises if the enterprise is to be registered there.
Sole proprietorship: The name of sole proprietorships must include at the least the owner’s surname, such as Lars Holm or Holms Car Body Repairs.
Norwegian registered foreign businesses: Norwegian registered foreign businesses must state the name in the country of origin. The name of the activity in Norway must be stated in field 24.
Choosing a business name
For enterprises undertaking business and other enterprises to be registered in the Register of Business Enterprises, it is vital to be careful when selecting the name. The legislation governing this can be found in the Act relating to Business Names dated 21 June 1985. You can read more about selecting a name under “Start and Run Business” on altinn.no.
NOTE! The Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities does not check whether the legislation in the Act about Business Names have been complied with. The enterprise in question is responsible for doing this. Upon registration in the Register of Business Enterprises a check will be made to ensure that the business name satisfies the requirements in the Act relating to Business Names.
1.2 New business name

For enterprises registered in the Register of Business Enterprises, a change of the business name will be charged with a fee.
This field is only to be filled in if the enterprise is reporting a change of the registered business name. Remember that the name prior to the change must be stated in field 1.1 together with the previously assigned organisation number.
1.3 A separate name for the sub-entity
This field must only be filled in if the sub-entity operates under a different name than the name of the business. If the complete name is, for example, Lars Holms Hot Dog Stand, and you only use Grill Stall in your marketing and correspondence, only the latter name must be filled in here.










 
                                2 Type of notification                            



A notification can apply to one of the following matters
2.1 Registration of an enterprise not registered previously
2.2 Change in registered information or new information
2.3 Decision to dissolve an enterprise
2.4 Striking off an enterprise
If the notification refers to information about the sub-entity, field 9 and 10 must be filled in. The notification must be submitted to the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities in connection with transfer/takeover and closure/termination of a sub-entity.
2.1 Enterprise not previously registered
Tick here only if the enterprise previously has not been registered in the Central Coordinating for Legal Entities.
If you register a new enterprise when you take over an existing business, you must also tick field 9a for purchase/takeover. Field 10a must be filled in with information about the previous owner. If a new enterprise is being registered in connection with the start of a new business, the starting date must be entered in field 9a of the form.
NOTE: A new enterprise is not created if there has been only a change of ownership of shares in a limited company, a partnership or the like. In such cases no notification of a new enterprise needs to be submitted, but rather a notification to change the information registered about the enterprise. A general partnership must in such cases submit notification of change of partners.
2.2 Changes/new information
If the enterprise is already registered in the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities, in most cases you will have to tick field 2.2, «Changes/New information». This applies even if the enterprise is applying to register in one of the affiliated registers to the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities, in which it is not yet registered. If, for example, a sole proprietorship is already registered in the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities and then submits a notification to be registered in the Register of Business Enterprises, the «Changes/New information» field must be ticked.
If the change or new information is about a decision to dissolve or strike off the enterprise, there are fields for this that must be ticked.
Always fill in the organisation number of the enterprise and registered name in field 1.1.
Otherwise only fill in the fields that apply for the change.
If the change means that registered information is to be deleted without being replaced by new information, you put «utgår» (to be omitted) in the relevant field.
Pursuant to section 6 of the Regulations governing fees for services from the Brønnøysund Register Centre, there is a fee for enterprises registered in the Register of Business Enterprises when making certain changes.
This applies to the following changes:

Decision about capital reduction
Decision to merge
Decision to demerge
Change of business name, including change of name due to conversion
– from a general partnership with joint liability (ANS) to a general partnership with shared liability (DA), and also the reverse
– from a limited company (AS) to a public limited company ASA), and also the reverse
– from a co-operative (SA) to a limited company (AS) or public limited company (ASA)
Change of partner, including stepping down from being a partner in a general partnership with joint liability (ANS), a general partnership with shared liability (DA), an inter-municipal company (IKS) and a jointly owned shipping company
Change of liability proportions in a general partnership with shared liability (DA), an inter-municipal company (IKS) and a jointly owned shipping company with shared liability (DA)
Change of general partner in a limited partnership (KS).

2.3 Decision to dissolve the enterprise
For most types of companies in the Register of Business Enterprises, this field must be used when winding down the enterprise. For limited company, public limited company, limited partnership, general partnership, co-operative and inter-municipal company, dissolution and closure are undertaken in two stages. When it is reported that an enterprise is to be dissolved, it cannot be struck off before the time limit for creditors has expired and the liquidation accounts have been approved by an authorised body.
The field to be ticked must also be used for notifications about dissolution for merger and demerger.
Most other types of companies are struck off without prior notification. This applies to sole proprietorships, companies with limited liability, jointly owned shipping companies, municipal business enterprises, county municipal business enterprises, associations and other entities. See the instructions under field 2.4.
2.4 Striking off an enterprise
This field must be used if the enterprise is to be struck off all registers (the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities and affiliated registers). Bear in mind that when you wish to strike off an enterprise and at the same time register a new one, two forms must be filled in.
Remember to state in field 9b what is to be done with the enterprise’s sub-entity.
Striking off only from affiliated registers
It is possible for the enterprise to be struck off from one of the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities’ affiliated registers without being struck off from the other affiliated registers.
Striking off from the Register of Business Enterprises
Most types of organisation are struck off because they have ceased to exist. Consequently, they must be struck off all registers. However, for companies with limited liability, foundations, associations and other entities, the rule is that they must be struck off from the Register of Business Enterprises when business operations have been closed down for good.
Sole proprietorships which have the right to be registered, but are not under the obligation to register in the Register of Business Enterprises, can also be struck off from the Register of Business Enterprises without having ceased to exist. If the enterprise in such cases wishes to be registered or continue to be in the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities, notification of separate striking off from the Register of Business Enterprises must be entered in field 26. If so, field 2.4 of the form must not be ticked.










 
                                3 Registration in other registers                            



Here you specify which affiliated register the enterprise is to be registered in. Field 3 must be filled in when the enterprise is to be registered in an affiliated register where it is not already registered.
Field 3.1 and field 3.2 apply for registration of information in the NAV Aa Register.
Foundations
The form has no separate field to be ticked for registration in the Foundation Register. The Lottery and Foundation Authority is automatically notified of all foundations reporting registration in the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities. A fee must be paid for the registration in the Foundation Register. The rates are given in the regulations dated 21 December 2004 for the Foundation Act. Foundations running a business are not liable to pay a fee to the Foundation Register but rather to the Register of Business Enterprises for new registrations.
3.1 The Register of Business Enterprises
What is the Register of Business Enterprises?
The Register of Business Enterprises is in general a register for enterprises conducting business in Norway.
A fee must be paid for registration in the Register of Business Enterprises. The rates are stipulated in the regulations dated 16 December 2003, no. 1551, for fees for services from the Brønnøysund Register Centre.
Which enterprises must be registered in the Register of Business Enterprises?
Some types of organisations are, by law, under the obligation to register or have the right to register in the Register of Business Enterprises.
Sole proprietorships
Sole propritorships are under the obligation to register in the Register of Business Enterprises if they employ more than five employees in permanent positions as their main employment or undertake trade with goods bought to be sold. “Main employment” means a position where the person works more than 20 hours a week. Sole proprietorships that are not under the obligation to register still have the right do so.
Condominium flat owners
Condominium flat owners that have been converted into individual units pursuant to a petition lodged after 1 January 1998 are obliged to register in the Register of Business Enterprises if they have nine or more sections. Condominium flat owner with eight or fewer sections have the right to register in the Register of Business Enterprises. Condominium flat owners that have been converted into individual units pursuant to a petition lodged before 1 January 1998 are not obliged to register.
Limited companies, public limited companies, co-operatives, limited partnerships, general partnerships and such, must always register in the Register of Business Enterprises.
Other types of companies, such as companies with limited liability, foundations and associations, only need to register in the Register of Business Enterprises if they conduct business activities. Business activities mean activities of some duration and a certain scope, established with the intention to yield or in reality yielding financial profits.
Foreign businesses
Foreign businesses must register in the Register of Business Enterprises if they conduct business activities in Norway or on the Norwegian continental shelf.
Take a look at the overview in field 8 of the form as well, or under “Start and Run Business” on altinn.no.
Remember to include the necessary attachments – see the overview “Required attachments for new registrations and changes in the Register of Business Enterprises”. If attachments are missing, the busines will not be registered.
3.2 Employees/others receiving  compensation
Employees. An employee is any person employed by another and receiving payment or other compensation for services rendered. Here it must be ticked yes if the enterprise expects to have its own employees, or intend to hire others who will receive a salary or remuneration.










 
                                4 Head office address (business address/visiting address)                            



Enterprises operating a business
State the business address, i.e. the head office’s street address or location.
Foreign enterprises
State the business address in the country of origin.

                                5 Postal address                            



Enterprises that have a separate postal address, for example a P.O. box, must state this in addition to the head office business address/visiting address.










 
                                6 The sub-entity's location address                            



If the sub-entity’s operations are located at a different address than the head office, this address must be stated here. If the activities are not bound to fixed premises or locations, but rather are ambulatory (for example building, construction or transport activities), the address of the administrative location of the enterprise, or alternatively the permanent location of attendance must be entered.










 
                                7 Submitter/chargeable                            



The submitter will be used as the addressee for all types of feedback on the notification, which means that confirmations and other letters, register printouts and the like will be sent to the submitter. This person is also responsible for paying fees to the Register of Business Enterprises.
If the field for the submitter has not been filled in, feedbacks, fee requests and the like will be sent to the enterprise. If the submitter has previously been assigned a customer number by the Brønnøysund Register Centre, this must be stated.
Case reference/attention for the submitter
Here the submitter can state a separate reference for the case if desired.










 
                                8 Type of organisation                            



This field must only be filled in when submitting notification of a new enterprise. Tick the appropriate place for the type of organisation to be registered. Only one alternative can be ticked. As a general rule, an enterprise cannot change the type of organisation without first being struck off and established again as a new enterprise.
Which types of organisation that are obliged to or have the right to register in the Register of Business Enterprises, appear from the references in the field and the guidance for field 3.1.
European businesses
European types of organisation that are common to all countries within the EU and EEA area. This includes European Companies (SE), European Cooperative Societies (SCE) and European Economic Enterprise Group (EEEG).

For more information about attachment requirements, contact the Register of Business Enterprises or the like, or visit our website brreg.no.

This type of organisation is used by a strictly limited group of enterprises, and only when none of the other organisation types are relevant. Examples of enterprises in this category include embassies, reindeer grazing districts and mountain region boards.










 
                                9a Launch or takeover of a sub-entity.                             



Date of foundation
State the date when the enterprise was founded.
For older enterprises that do not have accurate information about the foundation date, it is sufficient to state the year of foundation. The date of foundation must also be stated for Norwegian registered foreign businesses.
Sole proprietorships are not required to state the date of foundation.
Launch of sub-entity
Enterprises launching a sub-entity, must state the date when the activity started/will start.
Takeover of a sub-entity
If the notification applies to a takeover of a sub-entity, for instance if a limited company takes over a shoe store or a hairdressing salon from another limited company, the date of transfer must be stated here. You state the previous owner in field 10a.
Takeover/Transfer
For a sub-entity to be accepted as taken over or transferred, the same activities must be continued under the ownership of another enterprise. These conditions must be met: The assets that are necessary elements in the enterprise such as raw materials, production equipment, stocks, contracts and other, must in their entirety or essentially be transferred in one transaction. If the assets that are part of the enterprise are sold separately so the enterprise cannot continue, notification of closure of the enterprise need to be submitted.
Stock sales or changes of partners in general partnerships are not considered as takeover or transfer of a sub-entity.
A takeover or a transfer of a sub-entity must be reported when the business is continued with a new type of organisation or a new main entity, even if the owner(s) is the same. This may be the case when changing from a sole proprietorship to a limited company.










 
                                9b Transfer or closure of a sub-entity                            




Transfer of a sub-entity
If the notification relates to the sale of a sub-entity, for example when a limited company transfers a shoe shop or a hairdressing salon to another limited company, the date of transfer must be stated here.
Take a look at the guide to field 9a as well about takeover or transfer of a sub-entity.
Closure of a sub-entity
A sub-entity is closed down if its production of goods and/or services for some reason is ceased completely. The sub-entity also ceases to exist if:

A new owner launches a completely new business in the same premises.
A new owner moves the entire former sub-entity to a new location in another municipality.
It is moved to another municipality and a completely new business/production of goods and/or services is started with the same owner.

If the sub-entity is closed down, tick the field for this and enter the date of the closure. Please note that a notification of closure of a sub-entity does not mean that the enterprise is being struck off. If you wish the enterprise to be struck off, tick the box for «Striking off enterprise» in field 2.4.










 
                                10a Takeover of a sub-entity from                            



Provide information about the previous owner if the enterprise has taken over a sub-entity. State the previous owner’s organisation number if there is such a number.










 
                                10b Transfer of a sub-entity                            



Provide information about the new owner if the enterprise has transferred a sub-entity to another enterprise. State the new owner’s organisation number if this exists.
Remember that the inbox of the sub-entity in Altinn has to be cleared before the transfer. Sensitive information, such as sick notes and more, should be stored in a separate case/archive system before the transfer is registered. You will then prevent the acquirer from gaining access to sensitive information in the inbox of the sub-entity.










 
                                11 Activity/branch                            



11.1 Information about the activity
Information about the activity of the business is the basis for assigning the enterprise an industrial code. The industrial code is assigned pursuant to Standard Industrial Classification (SN2007). The industrial code is used to prepare statistics describing the Norwegian business and industry/ labour market according to business/trade.
Give as accurate a description as possible of the activities carried out or to be carried out. Bear in mind that it is not sufficient to state a general overriding purpose. Therefore you must state what will be produced/sold and/or which services/activities will be carried out. Make sure that you make it clear which industry the business belongs to.
Here are some examples of how detailed the description must be:

Agriculture: Growing of cereals. Raising of dairy cattle.
Transport: Freight transport by road. Taxi operation.
Industry: Manufacture of household and sanitary goods and of toilet requisites. Manufacture of builders ware of plastic
Trade: Agents involved in the sale of timber and building materials. Wholesale of electrical house- hold appliances and machines. Retail sale of meat and processed meat in specialised stores.
Building and construction: Groundwork. Construction of buildings.  Plumbing, heat and airconditioning installation.
Consultancy: Business consultancy activities. Consultancy services within soft ware development of customer- specified software.

If the enterprise operates in several lines of business, you must enter each of these in order of priority according to the amount of turnover or employment.
Enterprises that do not operate business activities must state the activity undertaken. Examples include marching bands or sports clubs.
Norwegian registered foreign businesses must state the activity being conducted in Norway, or must state what the basis for the registration is.
Upon a change, you must state what the new activity is and give the date this came into force. If the enterprise has started additional activities, you must also state the prior activities.
11.2 Confirmation of business operations
All sole proprietorships must confirm that the activity meets the requirements of the business operations.
A sole proprietorship runs business operations when the activity:

has turnover that can yield a surplus
has a certain time of duration, usually longer than one year
is not a pastime activity or individual assignments
