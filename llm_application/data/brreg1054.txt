Commitments and projects

Last updated: 9 May 2023.





We will make everyday life easier for everyone. This is reflected in the activities and our commitments. 

Within each of the areas below, we have activities to help achieve our goals.
 







 
                                Data and services with the right quality and good information security                            



Working with information security is a continuous process for safeguarding  values by identifying and managing risk, and implementing measures.
Information security in all our registers and services is crucial for maintaining the trust from our users. We aim to provide services with correct information, with the right quality and good information security.










 
                                Precautions of financial crime and work-related crime                            



We are one of Norway’s largest data sources, and have good knowledge of both business and register management. This makes us a key partner in the work of preventing financial crime and work-related crime. By looking at new ways of sharing data, and contributing to new innovative solutions in the area, we provide added value to the work of preventing financial crime and work-related crime in the Norwegian society.
Increased data sharing will, among other things, contribute to more transparency about financial matters. We identify rogue players and strengthen the competitive situation for the serious businesses. The benefits of this will increase trust in society, which is reflected in the government’s revised strategy against work-related crime, as well.










 
                                Digitalisation with a new service platform                            



New register platform
A main goal for the Brønnøysund Register Centre is that “The activity of the Brønnøysund Register Centre shall result in society having confidence that the registered data is secure and correct.
The purpose of the BRsys project, which develops the new register platform, is primarily to ensure our ability to continue to deliver on our society assignment. The management of our register services is primarily based on the architecture and technology established in 1992. Each digital service has a limited lifespan, and will gradually become obsolete and has to be replaced by new services.
The Brønnøysund Register started the BRsys project in 2017, and as a part of this project has come far in developing a new register platform. The register platform will facilitate stable operation and easier management of existing registers, as well as make it possible to establish new registers more quickly.
The BRsys project is in the process of modernising some of our largest and most important registers, such as The Register of Mortgaged Movable Property, The Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities and The Register of Business Enterprises. The new and modernised register services based on the register platform are also initiators of further development and enrichment of this. We expect that all new registers, or register-like services, will utilise the register platform to a greater or lesser degree.










 
                                Coherent services with a user-centred approach                            



The Brønnøysund Register Centre has important positions in the realisation of the life events. In order to succeed in creating coherent services for the users, we have to make arrangements for an efficient and simplified interaction. We are responsible for the life event “Start and run a business”, where we aim to make it easier for the business owners in all stages of the enterprise’s life, from idea to termination. Together with several public enterprises, we also contribute to the life event “Start and run a voluntary organisation”. The main goal is to create coherent, digital services, and thus simplifies everyday life for voluntary organisations in order to gain more time for activities.
Here you can read more about the work we are doing in cooperation with other agencies.
It is a key prerequisite that the coherent services are being developed and simplified according to the users’ needs.










 
                                Value creation, innovation and sustainable adjustment through cooperation within the business and the voluntary sector                             



We have extensive cooperation with actors in the private sector. It is important for the value creation that the data-driven development in this collaboration is both further developed and strengthened in the coming years.
Collaboration is one of the most important factor inputs for success within the digitalisation work internationally. As trade and interaction is constantly increasing across the national borders, it is important for us to continue our work to facilitate as simple, sustainable and secure a way as possible for the Norwegian business.
We have a central position through our work with Nordic Smart Government & Business. You can read more about that here.










 
                                Future needs for the right expertise and capacity                            



The right expertise and capacity are a prerequisite for success in our priority areas. We must retain critical expertise and continuously appeal to new skilled fellow workers. We will facilitate lifelong learning for our employees and we are looking for young talents.
We are always looking for different people.
