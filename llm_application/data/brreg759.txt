What is an association?

Last updated: 5 October 2022.





An association is a non-profit organisation with members, whose intention it is to front causes of idealistic, political or other character.

If the association is involved in sports activities, humanitarian work or other voluntary activities, you can register your club or association with us.
Assets and surplus
The surplus, the debt, or the assets cannot be divided between the members, as opposed to a limited company, where the owners can receive dividends from the company.
Non-statutory
The legal conditions of an association is not regulated by a separate law. However, there are principles developed over time, that are used in order to establish whether an entity is qualified to register as an association.
Report changes
Once the association is registered, you are obliged to update the registered information whenever changes are made.
