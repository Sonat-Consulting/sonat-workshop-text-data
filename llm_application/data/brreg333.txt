Attachment requirements for limited companies

Last updated: 6 November 2021.





When you register a limited company there are a number of documents that you must send in.
The documents that you must always attach when you register a company are

memomrandum and articles of association
declaration from an auditor or financial institution that shows the payment of the share deposit

With non-cash deposits you must attach

opening balance signed by the founders and confirmed by an auditor
statement signed by the founders and confirmed by an auditor

Remember a declaration of acceptance from those who have roles in the company
Board members must confirm that they have accepted their duties. If the company will have an auditor and/or accountant, declarations from these must be attached.
Separate declarations must be prepared, signed and attached, but for board members and accountants it is sufficient if they sign the Coordinated register notification.
In some cases you must attach the following:

minutes of a board meeting showing any decision that the companyâ€™s annual accounts will not be audited
agreement on special rights, cf. the Limited Liability Companies Act section 2-4
agreement regarding foundation expenses, cf. the Limited Liability Companies Act section 2-5
approval/concession from the Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway, if the purpose of the company is banking or insurance activities
