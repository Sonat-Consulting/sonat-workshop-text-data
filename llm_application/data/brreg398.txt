Application for a d-number

Last updated: 17 January 2022.





You must submit the application by mail, together with the paper version of the Coordinated register notification or the documents you wish to register. You cannot send the application for a d-number on its own.

The application form is for foreign nationals who do not previously have a Norwegian national identity number or d-number, but who require a d-number in connection with registration of role holders in the Central Coordinating Register of Legal Entities and the Register of Business Enterprises or registration of marriage settlements.
The guide to filling out the form is included in the form.
