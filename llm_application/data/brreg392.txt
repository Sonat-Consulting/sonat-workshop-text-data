Coordinated register notification









An association can be closed down if

a majority of the members agree on a dissolution or deletion
it ceases to exist as a result of declining activity over a period of time
all the members except one, have resigned
significant changes are made to the associationâ€™s statutes, to make it appear as a new unit
it is divided into several smaller units or merged with other units

You can close down the association by submitting the form Coordinated register notification.
You have to attach:

Documentation showing that the association has ceased to exist, or that a dissolution has been decided. This is normally minutes from the extraordinary annual meeting, where the members have decided to close down the activity.

If the association is registered in The Register of Business Enterprises, you have to attach

minutes from the annual meeting showing the decision of deletion

The minutes must be downloaded as an attachment to the form Coordinated register notification.
