                                2 The notification concerns                            



In this field you specify what the notifications concern. A notification may concern one of the following matters:
2.1 Enterprise not previously registered
2.2 Changes/new information
2.3 Striking off the enterprise
2.1 Enterprise not previously registered
You should only tick this box if the enterprise is not previously registered in the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities.
2.2 Changes/new information
If the enterprise is registered in the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities already, in most cases you should check off in field 2.2, Changes/new information. This applies even if the notification concerns registration in one of the affiliated registers of the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities.
Always state the organisation number of the enterprise and the registered name/business name in field 4.1. Continue by filling in only the relevant fields in the rest of the form. If the change involves that some information is struck out, you fill in the word “utgår” (=cancel) in the field in question. For enterprises registered in the Register of Business Enterprises, there will be a fee for changing the business name of the activity in Norway, cf. Regulations relating to fees for services from the Brønnøysund Register Centre, section 6.
2.3 Striking off the enterprise
Tick this box if the enterprise is to be struck off from all registers (the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities and the affiliated registers).
Striking off from affiliated registers only 
It is possible to strike of the enterprise from only one of the affiliated registers, without striking it off from the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities or the rest of the affiliated registers.
Striking off from the Register of Business Enterprises
If the enterprise no longer has business activity in Norway, it has no obligation nor right to be registered in the Register of Business Enterprises. If the enterprise still wants to or has to be registered in the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities, you must report a specific striking off from the Register of Business Enterprises in field 27 – “Other remarks”. If so, do not check off for striking off the enterprise.










 
                                3 Registration in Norway                            



You fill out this field if the enterprise is to be registered in an affiliated register, where it is not already registered.  Field 3.1 is for registration in the Register of Business Enterprises. Field 3.2 applies to enterprises that fall under the provisions of the Act relating to the Value Added Tax Register. Field 3.3 applies to registration of information in the NAV AA-register.










 
                                3.1 Registration in the Register of Business Enterprises                            



The Register of Business Enterprises is mainly a register for businesses in Norway. There is a fee for the registration in the Register of Business Enterprises. The rates are stated in the regulations of 16 December 2003 no. 1551 about fees for services from the Brønnøysund Register Centre.
If the enterprise operates its business activity in Norway or on the Norwegian continental shelf, this entails a duty to register in the Register of Business Enterprises. Two conditions determine whether the enterprise is obliged to, or has the right to register in the Register of Business Enterprises; the running of business activity and that this activity takes place in Norway.
Business activity
For the activity to be characterised as a business, it has to be of financial character and yield a profit. Furthermore, the activity must be of a certain duration and volume; i.e. the activity must last for more than 90 days and the turnover must be at least NOK 50,000 within a 12 month period.
Activity in Norway
An overall assessment must be done in order to determine whether the activity is carried out in Norway. Some of the factors that can be used for this include:

Is the activity run from an operation site in Norway?
Does the activity take place on Norwegian soil, for instance within construction or health services?
Will the customer have the impression of doing business with a Norwegian company?
Where are contracts made?
Where is the inventory stored?
Where does the payment take place?











 
                                3.2 Has turnover that falls under the provisions of the Act relating to the Value Added Tax Register                            



Enterprises with turnover that falls under the provisions of the Act relating to value added tax and with no permanent business address in Norway, must register a Norwegian representative. You report the Norwegian representative in field 19. This does not apply for
businesses residing in an EEA state or Great Britain, with which Norway has an agreement for the exchange of information and mutual assistance with the collection of VAT claims.










 
                                3.3 Employees – registration in NAV AA-register                            



An employee is anyone who is employed in someone else’s service for pay or any other compensation.
Here you must tick “yes” if the enterprise expects to get its own employees, or will hire others who will receive a salary or remuneration.

Only new enterprises have to register a notification address.
