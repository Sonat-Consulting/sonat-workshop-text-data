Can you order a certificate of registration for all types of organisations?
A certificate of registration is only an available product on enterprises registered in the Register of Business Enterprises. If, for example, you have an association that is only registered in the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities, you must instead order a register transcript. This transcript contains more detailed information than a certificate of registration, and is also an identification towards banks, customers and suppliers.
A certificate of registration contains information about


organisation number
business name
business address
board members
general manager

Certificate of registration in English
The certificate of registration does not contain information about the objectives as laid down in the articles of association. We can translate the objective into English. This may lead to longer processing time.
