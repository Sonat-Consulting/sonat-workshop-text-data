Last updated: 26 August 2022.





In order to establish a co-operative, a memorandum of association will have to be created. 

The memorandum of association must contain information about

the names of the founders, business name, address and national identity number/organisation number
the name, address and national identity number of the board members

the articles of association

The founders have no obligation to make deposits at the foundation, but if a deposit is to be made, this must be stated in the memorandum.
The memorandum must be dated and signed by all the founders. When all the founders have signed the memorandum, the membership is registered and the enterprise is established.
The memorandum must also show any information about

whether deposits in connection with the foundation, is to be setteld with other assets than money
whether someone are given special rights at the foundation

 







 
                                Content requirements at deposit capital                            



There are no requirements for a minimum capital when you establish a co-operative, and it can therefore be formed without any capital contributions. The founders may also make deposits at the foundation.
If the founders have contributed capital in connection with the founding, the memorandum has to contain information about

the amount paid by each founder
the entire amount of the contributed capital
the time of the capital settlement

If contributions are made in other assets than money, the memorandum must contain information about

which assets are included
the name and address of the contributor
which conditions apply

Before registering the company in the Register of Business Enterprises, any capital to be contributed must be fully paid-up.
