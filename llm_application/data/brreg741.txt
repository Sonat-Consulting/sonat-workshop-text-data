About the State Aid Register

Last updated: 29 September 2022.





The State Aid Register (ROFS) is a national register for grants of state aid based on the EEA Agreement.

The main task
The register shall contribute to availability and transparency regarding allocations of state aid. The public support must be published in the register to be legal.
What is to be registered?
Public aid that falls under the EEA Agreement, i.e. individual allocations on EUR 500,000 or more, must be reported to ROFS. However, the register is still open to report allocations below this amount, if the granting authority so wishes.
How is the information used in ROFS?
The register will make it easier for public authorities who consider providing public support, to obtain information about other public support to the business that must be included in the assessment. Furthermore, the information in the register could form the basis of the policy making in this area, and provide the Norwegian Authorities and the EFTA Surveillance Authority (ESA) an opportunity to obtain an overview and control of state aid granted in Norway.
Who are the users of the register?
Granting authorities, i.e state institutions, counties and municipalities, are using the register in order to report individual allocations of public support. An overview of registered allocations will at all times be publicly available.
The history behind the establishment
The register was established on 1 July 2016 to create more transparency of state aid based on the rules on state aid in the EEA Agreement.
