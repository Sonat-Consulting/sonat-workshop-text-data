Announcements from the Register of Business Enterprises

Last updated: 28 October 2021.





The Register of Business Enterprises registers information on Norwegian and foreign enterprises subject to register and entitled to register in Norway. The register makes public announcements of the registration of new enterprises, important changes, dissolution and striking off the register. The announcements are normally posted on the internet almost immediately after the information has been entered into the Register of Business Enterprises.
New registration of enterprises
Announcement of new registrations always include information about the enterprise’s name, type of organisation, organisation number, objective and business address. If the enterprise has a board and/or a general manager, the announcement also includes information about the names of these. For sole proprietorships, the announcement includes the name of the owner of the enterprise. For general and limited partnerships, the announcement contains the name of liable partners and the general partner, respectively.
Closure of enterprises
Announcements of striking off always include information about the name of the enterprise, type of organisation, organisation number and business address.
The striking-off procedure varies according to the organisation form of the enterprises. In some cases so-called dissolution must be reported to the Register of Business Enterprises prior to being struck off the register of enterprises. On the basis of the notification of dissolution the Register of Business Enterprises announces the notification to creditors.
Information in the notification to creditors – creditor deadline
Some changes in registered enterprises are considered so important that they may not be carried out without prior notification to creditors about the enterprise. Therefore, the Partnerships Act may include provisions for issuing a  notification to creditors.
Changes in registered enterprises
An announcement on changes includes information about the name of the enterprise, type of organisation, organisation number, business address and information on the change that has been made.
In addition to the new registration of enterprises, striking off of enterprises and creditor notifications, most other changes in registered information on an enterprise are also announced. A list of these announcements is provided below.
When using this list, it is important to bear in mind the following:

Not all changes in all registered enterprises are announced
When the list refers to exceptions, where information is not announced for some types of organisation, this means that the information cannot be registered, and therefore cannot be announced, for this type of organisation.

Not all information has to be registered for everyone who belongs to a particular type of organisation. For some types of organisation it is optional to register some information, or the obligation to register information may depend on matters that do not relate to the type of organisation. (For example, the auditing obligation for a number of types of organisation depends on variable factors.) Announcements of changes in such cases depend on whether the information that is not under the registration obligation has been registered for the enterprise in question.
