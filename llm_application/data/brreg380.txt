Deletion of marriage settlement

Last updated: 2 December 2021.





You can delete a marriage settlement with us when the marriage or the partnership has been terminated upon divorce or death. In addition, the estate must be settled.

How to delete a marriage settlement

Enter directly on the registered marriage settlement or a copy that you want to delete it. We also accept that you request deletion in a letter in which the marriage settlement is well identified with the name and the national identiy numer for both, and preferably the journal number.
You must confirm that the estate has been settled
If you are divorced, you must attach a copy of your divorce filing.
Upon death, you must attach a copy of a death certificate or a certificate of probate

If multiple marriage settlements are registered, you must do this for each of them.
It is sufficient that one of you asks for deletion of the marriage settlement. A solicitor may also request deletion on behalf of one or both parties. Heirs may also request deletion.
If you never entered into a marriage, you must attach a confirmation from the National Population Register showing that you have not been married to each other.
Send the request of deletion to
The Brønnøysund Register Centre
The Register of Marriage Settlements
P.O. Box 905
NO-8910 Brønnøysund
Change of previously entered marriage settlement
If you are still married and want to restore joint property, you must create a new marriage settlement. You must also do this if you wish to change or supplement a marriage settlement. It is not possible to delete a marriage settlement if the marriage or the partnership is not terminated.
