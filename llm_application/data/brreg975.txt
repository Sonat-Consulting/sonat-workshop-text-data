Questions about how we can see a marriage settlement
 







 
                                How can I find out if someone has registered a marriage settlement?                             



You can order a mortgage certificate in our webshop. You must provide the national identity number of the persons in question. We send you the mortgage certificate free of charge by email.
The mortgage certificate shows whether a marriage settlement is registered after 1981 or there are other liens on the person in the Register of Marriage Settlements, but it does not show the contents of the marriage settlement. If you believe that a marriage settlement has been registered with us before 1 January 1981, you must contact us by phone to order such a mortgage certificate.










 
                                How do I know the contents of the marriage settlement?                             



You can order a copy of a marriage settlement if you want to see the entire content. Here you can see what it costs.
