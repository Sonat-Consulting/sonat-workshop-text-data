About the Register of Political Parties

Last updated: 27 October 2021.





The Register of Political Parties is a register of political parties that want protection of the party name, primarily the nationwide parties.

Registration in the register also provides simpler formal requirements for the party’s list proposals and for approval of ballot papers.
Main task
The register is a register of political parties in Norway. The main purpose is to provide parties the opportunity to aquire the exclusive right to submit lists under the party name.
The register verifies that any new party name cannot be confused with previously registered party names. In addition, new party names must not be confused with present and past ideological concepts or other party history and traditional links. New party names should not be confused with names in Sami political enterprises. Questions about Sami political enterprises should be directed to the Sami Parliament.
What and who can be registered?
All parties that meet the requirements for registration can register in the register. Here you can read more about registration, attachment requirements and which party names are protected.
The effect of the registration ceases and the party name becomes available when the party has not made a list in any constituency in two consecutive parliamentary elections.
The register contains information about the party’s executive body, which according to the Election Act shall represent the party to the electoral authorities. In addition, it contains information about the party’s name, orgnisation number, address and contact person that is registered in the Central Coordination Register for Legal Entities.
Registration in the register provides the basis for those who can represent the party when dealing with electoral authorities. The fact that a party is registered in the Register of Political Parties also affects the rules that apply to the party’s polling list proposals and for the approval of ballot papers.
To register a party in The Register of Political Parties, the party must also be registered in the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities.

The history behind the establishment
Under the previous election law, an arrangement had been established for the registration of political parties, where the task was added to the Oslo County Court as a Notary Public. The regulations about the registration of political parties were contained in at that time Election Act of 1985.
In connection with the new election law that came into force on 1 September 2002, a number of changes were made to the system of regisration of poitical parties. Among other things, it was decided that the register should be kept be the Brønnøysund register Centre. We took over the charge of the register from 1 September 2002.
