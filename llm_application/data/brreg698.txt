DigiHelgeland summer camp

Last updated: 23 August 2022.





Norway's coolest summer job?

Every summer, we organise the DigiHelgeland summer camp – a camp for ten students within IT, law, design, information management and data analysis. The summer camp is a collaborative project between the Brønnøysund Register Centre, the Norwegian Digitalisation Agency and Digital Helgeland.
As a student at the summer camp, you will get the opportunity to deal with real issues that citizens and businesses are facing, and find new solutions for these. You will work in cross-disciplinary teams with other students, and gain good support from your own experienced colleagues and mentors.
Rent and travel expenses round trip Brønnøysund will be covered by us. The application deadline is yearly around 1 March.
