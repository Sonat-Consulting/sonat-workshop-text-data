The marriage settlement will be registered
Â 
What occurs after you have submitted the form of marriage settlement?
The marriage settlement will now be checked by us and will be registered if everything is correct. The processing time can be close to fourteen days.
When the marriage settlement has been registered, this will be stated with a register stamp. We return the original to the submitter of the form. You will also receive a mortgage certificate. This will not show the contents of the marriage settlement, but only what you have ticked in the form. The mortgage certificate also shows if something else has been registered on you in the Register of Mortgage Movable Property.
The fee for the registration will be sent by post to the submitter in retrospect. Fee for registration can be found in our fee list.
It is possible to order a copy of the marriage settlement by calling us. See overview of what it costs. You can make an order of a mortgage certificate in our webshop.
Are you going to change the marriage settlement?
If you want to change, supplement or revoke the marriage settlement, you must create a new marriage settlement.
Deletion of marriage settlement
It is only possible to delete a marriage settlement upon divorce or death, or if the marriage never was entered.
