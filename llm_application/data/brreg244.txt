Information about appeal

Last updated: 19 October 2021.





If a registration of a mortgage has been refused, you can either correct the stated deficiencies or appeal the decision. 

You do not need to appeal if you correct the deficiencies in the document. It appears from the register transcript why the document was not registered. The corrected document must be resubmitted to us for registration.
How to appeal a decision
If you disagree with our refusal decision, you can appeal.  You must appeal within one month of the decision being sent from us. The appeal must be in writing and contain

which decision your appeal refers to
why you believe the decision about refusal is wrong
original document

Submit the appeal to:
The Register of Mortgaged Movable Property
P.O. Box 905
8910 Brønnøysund
How much does an appeal cost?
It costs 6 times the court fee to appeal. An overview of current rates for court fees can be found in the court fee regulations. You must pay the fee in advance.
This is how we process the appeal
If you appeal, we will reconsider the decision. If we uphold the decision, the appeal will be forwarded to the Hålogaland Courts of Appeal for a decision.
