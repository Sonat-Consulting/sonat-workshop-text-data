Confirmation of share capital contributions in a public limited company

Last updated: 18 August 2022.





Upon registration of a new public limited company and by an increase of the share capital, you must attach a declaration from an auditor, a financial institution, an attorney or an accountant which confirms that the share capital has been received by the company.

A financial institution, an attorney or an accountant can only provide the confirmation if the entire share capital or the capital increase is issued in cash.
The confirmation must include:

information on the contributed amount, stating that it applies to share capital contributions
the business name of the company to which the confirmation involves
the date
the signature of the issuer of the confirmation
the name of the financial institution, the auditor, the attorney or the accountant providing the confirmation

It is not sufficient to enclose a signed receipt, a bank statement or similar.
Electronic submission of confirmation
The confirmation must be signed electronically if the notification to the Register of Business Enterprises has been submitted electronically. Therefore, it is not necessary to date and sign it otherwise.
When you have uploaded the confirmation, you have to enter the organisation number of the auditor, the financial institution, the attorney or the accountant who drew up the confirmation. They will then receive a signing task in their inbox in Altinn, which they have to enter and sign before the notification can be submitted.
If you want to read more about electronic signing, you can do that on the page Coordinated register notification.
