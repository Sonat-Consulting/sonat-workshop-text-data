Accomplish sighting shots
Once you have fired sighting shots, you record the number of shots in the app.
This is how to get your sighting shots approved

Select shooting test, press new registration and select mandatory shots in the app
Enter the number of shots and proceed to control
You will now receive a QR code in the app that you present to an inspector. After the inspector has scanned the QR code, press proceed.
Then read the inspector’s QR code with your app. This is your receipt for accomplished sighting shots.
The documentation will be transferred from your app to My hunting profile when you have coverage on your mobile.
When 30 mandatory shots have been fired, you can undergo the shooting test.

How many sighting shots can I register?
In order to undergo a shooting test, you must carry out at least 30 sighting shots at a minimum of 2 days.  Up to 15 shots for the shooting test each day will be approved. It is possible to register more than 15 shots in the app per day, as some licencee require more than 30 mandatory shots in total before hunting.
Have you participated in a scheduled competion this year?
The shots then count as mandatory shots in the shooting test for big game. Your competion shots are automatically included in the app.
