Establish a foundation

Last updated: 28 February 2022.





You can basically establish a foundation if a asset value of at least NOK 100,000 is made independently available to the foundation, and the foundation has a specific and long-term purpose.

At least NOK 200,000 must be made available for commercial foundations.
Foundations are considered created when the memorandum of association is available. If the foundation is created by will, this is regarded as the memorandum of association, and the foundation will be considered as established at the time of death.
If you are going to create and register a foundation, the following documents must be drawn up:

Memorandum of association (a will, if any)
Articles of associaton
Declaration from the auditor
Opening balance sheet

You will find an overview of what information these attachments should contain on the website auxiliary forms and templates to The Norwegian Foundation Authority. There you will also find examples of templates you can use in conjunction with the establishment.
