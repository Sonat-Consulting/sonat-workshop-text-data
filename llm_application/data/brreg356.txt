Registration of boat teams, landowner teams or other clubs

Last updated: 7 November 2021.





Are you going to register activitites that you have created jointly with someone else to attend to private interests?

Examples of such interests may be operation and maintenance of water, road, garage, sewage, boat, wharf and landowner teams.
Can my association register to obtain an organisation number?
In order to be registered, it is a requirement that your club is defined as a type of organisation and that the rules applying are met. We do a check of this before registration.
If you are going to organise a joint activity, there are three types of organisation which are the most common. These are joint ownership according to the law of property, association and co-operative (SA). Other types are also possible, but usually not appropriate. The most central types of organisation are listed in section 4 of the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities Act.
Joint ownership according to the law of property is regulated by the Joint Ownership Act, but most of the law can be deviated by agreement. Associations do not follow a separate law, but follow the non-statutory principles of associations. Co-operatives are regulated by the Cooperative Societies Act.
We can neither recommend nor make any assessment of type of organisation prior to the registration. This must be decided by the persons who are involved in the founding of the organisation. You can find more information about these types of organisation under Useful links.
Are we required to register?
No organisations are required to register. However, many circumstances might make it necessary, for example, if you are going to run a business,, have employees, create a bank account or subscribe to a power supplier.
What do we have to do before registration?
If you already have an organisation which corresponds to a specific type of organisation, you can submit a notification about registration. It is important to check that the articles of association are in correspondence with the chosen type of organisation and that the relevant regulations are followed. If there are provisions in the statutes that are not legal for the chosen type of organisation, you have to amend the statutes first. Such changes require a decision from the annual meeting.
If you do not have a type of organisation, you must first consider which type is the most suitable, and then formalize this. For associations and co-operatives you do this by signing the memorandum of association, whereas for a joint ownership according to the law of property, you have to establish a co-operative agreement. Irrespective of the choice of organisation form, you have to create a set of statutes regulating the running of the organisation, with the exception of joint ownership according to the law of property.
