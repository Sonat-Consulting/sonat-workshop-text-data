Nordic Smart Government

Last updated: 27 October 2021.





The Brønnøysund Register Centre and the Nordic register managers are collaborating on the Nordic Smart Government (NSG) project. 

The NSG’s ambition is that the Nordic region is to become a world-leading digital and integrated region. We are responsible for leading the work together with the four other Nordic register managers.
The object is to lay the groundwork for financial data to be exchanged smarter, more securely and more quickly between enterprises and authorities across the Nordic region. The enterprise’s reporting to the public sector will be much easier compared to today and access to better data will provide increased efficiency and better control options.
Access to real-time data makes it easier for enterprises to do business more secure. It also provides increased liquidity – to the great advantage of both the business operations as well as the welfare. This will strengthen small and medium-sized enterprises in Norway and lead to the development of new services and products that will increase competitiveness, growth and development in the Nordic region.
According to a report from Ernst & Young, NSG has a profit potential for small and medium-sized enterprises in the Nordic region of NOK 250 billion per year, over a ten-year period.
Nordic Smart Government will continue to work with six core areas in the coming years

digital sales documents
digital product information
digital start-up for small and medium-sized enterprises
secure sharing of accounting information
delivery of reliable data of high quality
simplified reporting

In Norway, we work closely with the Tax Administration and Statistics Norway about NSG. The Norwegian Digitalisation Agency and the Norwegian Agency for Public and Financial Management (DFØ) have also contributed, and the collaboration will be expanded with more agencies and private actors.
