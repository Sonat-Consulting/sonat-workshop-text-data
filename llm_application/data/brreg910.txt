Guide to common form for sole proprietorship, BR1025, for registration in

The Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities
The Register of Business Enterprises
The NAV Aa register
The Business Register of Statistics Norway

How to fill in the form:
 







 
                                1 Business name                            



1.1 The sole proprietorship’s complete name
The field must always be filled in.
Enter the enterprise’s complete business name and organisation number. If it is in regards to a new registration, the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities will assign the organisation number.
The name of sole proprietorships must always include the owner’s surname, for example Lars Holm or Holms Car Body Repairs.
On the page How do I choose a name for my enterprise? you can read more about choice of names and what considerations you need to take.
1.2 New business name
This field is only to be filled in if you are reporting a change of the registered business name. Remember that the name prior to the change must be stated in field 1.1 together with the organisation number. If the sole proprietorship is registered in the Register of Business Enterprises, a change of the business name will be charged with a fee. Here you can see an overview of fees for registration.
1.3 A separate name of the sub-entity
This field must only be filled in if the business operates a sub-entity under a different name than the enterprise’s business name. If the complete name is, for example, Lars Holms Hot Dog Stand, and you only use Grill Stall in your marketing and correspondence, only the latter name must be filled in here.










 
                                2 Type of notification                            



A notification can be made about the following matters:

If you want to report transfer, takeover or closure of your sub-entity, you need to fill in fields 8 and 9 in the form.
2.1 Sole proprietorship not previously registered

2.2 Changes/new information
Tick here if you wish to make changes to the registered information. Registration in or striking off from one or more of our affiliated registers is considered to be a change.

Bear in mind that a change of name for sole proprietorships registered with the Register of Business Enterprises is subject to a fee. Here you can see an overview of fees for registration.

An activity will be regarded as taken over or transferred, if the same activity continues, but with a different main entity as owner/operator.
These terms must be met:
The assets that are included as  necessary components of the activity, such as raw materials, production equipment, inventories, contracts and other, must be transferred in their entirety or substantially as a whole. If the assets included in the activity are sold separately, so that the activity cannot continue, you must report the closure of the activity.

Inital registration of a sub-entity
Upon new registration of a sub-entity, you must enter the starting date of the acitivity, or will start.
Takeover of a sub-entity
If the notification applies to a takover of a sub-entity – for example if your sole proprietorship takes over a farm or a kiosk from a different enterprise, please enter the date of the takeover here.
You can read more about initial registration or takeover of a sub-entity  here.










 
                                8b Transfer or closure of a sub-entity

Closure of a sub-entity

a new owner launches a completely new activity in the same premises
a new owner moves the entire former activity to a new location in another municipality
the activity is moved to another municipality and a completely new activity starts with the same owner

Please note that a notification of closure of a sub-entity does not mean that the enterprise is being struck off. If you wish the enterprise to be struck off, tick the box for «Striking off sole proprietorship» in field 2.3.










 
                                9a Takeover of a sub-entity

Bear in mind that the inbox of the sub-entity in Altinn should be emptied before the transfer.

This may prevent the acquirer from gaining access to sensitive information contained in the sub-entity’s inbox.










 
                                10 Activity/branch                            



10.1 Information about the activity
Information about the activity of the business is the basis for assigning the enterprise an industrial code. The industrial code is assigned pursuant to Standard Industrial Classification (SN2007). The industrial code is used to prepare statistics describing the Norwegian business and industry/labour market according to business/trade.
You have to give as accurate a description as possible of the activities carried out or to be carried out. Bear in mind that it is not sufficient to state a general overriding purpose. You must state what will be produced/sold and/or which services/activities will be carried out. Make sure that you make it clear which category the business/trade belongs to.
Here are some examples of how detailed the description must be:

Agriculture: Growing of cereals. Raising of dairy cattle
Transport: Freight transport by road. Taxi operation.
Industry:  Manufacture of household and sanitary goods and of toilet requisites. Manufacture of builders ware of plastic.
Trade: Agents involved in the sale of timber and building materials. Wholesale of electrical household appliances and machines. Retail sale of meat and processed meat.
Building and construction: Site preparation. Construction of residential and non-residential buildings.
Consultancy: Business consultancy activities. Consultancy services in software development of customer- specified software

If the sole proprietorship operates in several lines of business, you must enter each of these in order of priority according to the amount of turnover or employment. State the main activity first as this determines which industrial code you will receive.
If you are submitting a notification of changes, you must state what the new activity is and state the date when it started. If you start another activitiy in addition to the prior activities, you must state both in the form.
10.2 Confirmation of business operations
You must confirm that the activity meets the requirements for business activity.
A sole proprietorship conducts business operations when the activity

has turnover that can yield a surplus
has a certain time of duration, usually longer than one year
is not a pastime activity or individual assignments

In a sole proprietorship, you must always state the owner. By owner we mean the person who has unlimited personal liability for the sole proprietorship’s obligations. If the sole proprietorship has a general manager and/or a business manager, this should be stated as well.
You must state the name, home address and national identity number or d-number for the persons who are to be registered.

This field must only be filled in if the enterprise has an auditor.
Normally small sole proprietorships do not have auditing obligations. An auditing obligation begins only when

the turnover exceeds NOK 6 million and
the balance sheet shows assets of more than NOK 23 million, or

The accountant must be approved by the Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway and registered in the Register of Accountants.

Power of procuration is an authorisation to act and sign on behalf of the enterprise, associated with the daily operations.
Here you specify who has been assigned the power of procuration. When you as the owner of a sole proprietorship assign a power of procuration, you give other proxy to act on behalf of your sole proprietorship. You can give power of procuration to the general manager or other persons.
If several persons have been assigned a power of procuration, it must be made clear whether they have this authority separately or jointly. Restrictions beyond this cannot be registered. When changing the information about who has been assigned the power of procuration, all the proxies must be listed.
