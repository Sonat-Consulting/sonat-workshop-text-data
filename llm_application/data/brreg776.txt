Our mission

Last updated: 26 October 2022.





We provide order and overview of information on financial issues, ownership and liability in businesses. 

The Brønnøysund Register Centre is a government body under the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries, which manages the registers on behalf of nine ministries. Every year we receive an allocation letter that is a key governing document from the ministry. The allocation letter provides the society assignment and goals during the period. It outlines our financial framework and what priorities, performance targets and reporting requirements. Based on this, we will lay out our strategy.
Our mission for 2022 is:
We will contribute to increased economic growth through being a national register manager and data source. The agency is to manage register data in a way that provides security, order and overview for the business community, the voluntary sector, citizens and the public sector.
Our strategy is to be the preferred register manager and we will contribute to increased data-driven development.
It should be obvious to point to the Brønnøysund Register Centre when new relevant registers are being established. Our data is of great value and must be turned into business opportunities and added value for the users. Data-driven means providing a starting point for register and commercial data, as well as developing added value.
Our focus areas are:

Data and services with correct quality and good information security
To prevent financial and work-related crime in society by ensuring orderly business practices
Digitalisation with a new service platform
Coherent services the users at the centre
Economic growth, innovation and sustainable transition through cooperation in business and the voluntary sector
Future needs for the right competence and capacity


Our vision is: Trust and modernisation of society

Annual report
The annual report will be submitted to the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries each year. It provides an overall picture of the Brønnøysund Register Centre’s activities and finances. We report on the goals that the ministry has drawn up for us in the allocation letter.
User surveys
We work systematically to improve, and we continuously measure how we succeed with our goals and strategies. We complete, among other things, annual user surveys to gain knowledge about what the users think.
