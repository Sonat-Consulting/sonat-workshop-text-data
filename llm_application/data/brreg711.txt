Roles in a general partnership

Last updated: 25 August 2022.





Mandatary roles required in a general partnership are partners.

If the partnership does not have a board, it must have a person in the role as general manager, business manager or contact person. Accountant, board, signature and power of procuration are roles which are optional to register. The partnership meeting is the highest authority in a general partnership.
The partnership is subject to conditional audit obligation. Read more about this under Auditor.

A general partnership must have at least two partners. Both natural persons and legal persons can be partners. Private and public limited companies and general partnerships are examples of legal persons.
Only the participants in a general partnership have the right to vote in the partnership meeting, unless the partnership agreement states otherwise.
