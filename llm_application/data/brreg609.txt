Announcements from the Register of Company Accounts

Last updated: 2 June 2022.





We announce approved annual accounts, interim balance sheets and notifications of compulsory dissolution. 

In this register you will find annual accounts from all enterprises with an accounting obligation. The announcement normally takes place two days after the approval of the annual accounts.
 







 
                                Approved annual accounts                            



Every year, all enterprises with an accounting obligation must submit complete annual accounts to the Register of Company Accounts within one month after the approval by the general meeting or equivalent body.
Complete annual accounts means final accounts containing:

note disclosures
annual report (does not apply to small enterprises)
cash flow statement (does not apply to small enterprises)
auditor’s report, if any

The financial year normally follows the calendar year during the period from 1 January to 31 December. If the terms are met, deviating financial years may also be used. The annual accounts must be submitted to the Register of Company Accounts no later than 31 July in the year following the ordinary financial year. The corresponding deadline is 31 January for those with an end date prior to 1 July.

                                Approved interim balance sheets                            



When the enterprise makes certain decisions, the interim balance sheets must be submitted to the Register of Company Accounts. It registers and announces approved interim balance sheets.
The announcement of the interim balance sheet normally takes place the day after the approval of the interim balance sheet.
The announcement of approved interim balance sheets will always contain information about the business name, type of organisation, organisation number and business address. In addition, the announcement contains the date for the receipt of the interim balance sheet, the balance date, as well as the adoption approved by the general meeting.
