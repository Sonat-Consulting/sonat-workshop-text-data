Everyone who sends out advertisements aimed at private individuals, is obliged to update their lists towards the Central Marketing Exclusion Register at least every month.
However, you will still be able to receive advertising from those you have an existing customer relationship with (bank, insurance, book club etc.) You can be deleted from such lists if you want to, but for that to happen, you have to contact each company in order to have your name and address deleted.
The arrangement applies to private individuals
Businesses in trade and other legal persons, such as sole proprietorships, cannot choose to opt out.
Unaddressed advertising
If you want to opt out of unaddressed advertising, please contact Posten Norge AS. You will also find further information on the websites of the Consumer Authority.

Frequently asked questions about the Central Marketing Exclusion Register
 







 
                                Have I opted out of telehone sales?                            



By logging in to the Central Marketing Exclusion Register on this page, you can check whether you are registered against telephone sales, and which telephone numbers you have entered.










 
                                Do I need to update my removal?                            



No, that is not required. Once you have opted out, there is no need to update. You are removed until you choose to change this information.










 
                                I have opted out, but I still receive inquiries. What can I do?                            



If you have an active customer relationship (such as bank, insurance or book club), you can still be contacted. The same applies to marked surveys.
If someone contacts you in conflict with your removal, you may contact the Consumer Authority in order to make a complaint about the marketing.










 
                                Why am I called up in connection with market surveys even if though I have opted out?                            



Although you have opted out of telephone sales and marketing from non-profit organisations, you may still receive inquiries from market researchers, as this is not considered to be direct marketing. You can contact the individual enterprise conducting market surveys, and request to be deleted from their local address register.










 
                                Can I opt out of advertising from political parties?                            



No, you cannot opt out of this in the Central Marketing Exclusion Register. The right to opt out only applies to advertising that is an attempt to sell something or ask for financial support. For further information about the set of rules regarding this, please look at the website of the Consumer Authority.
