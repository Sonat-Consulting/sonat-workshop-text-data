Attachment requirements for clubs or associations

Last updated: 25 August 2022.





When registering an association or a club for the first time, a certain amount of attachments is required.

This is because we need to make sure that the information reported to us is correct, so that every public and private actor using the information can be sure that the information has been checked and approved.
Documents you need to attach when registering an association or a club

memorandum of association
articles of association
minutes from the annual meeting showing the election of the board

Remember to sign the form.
If the association is going to have an auditor or an accountant, they have to confirm in the Coordinated register notification that they take on the assignment.
