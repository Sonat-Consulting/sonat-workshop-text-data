Roles in a housing cooperative

Last updated: 9 March 2022.





The mandatory roles in a housing cooperative are a board and an auditor. 

Business manager, contact person, accountant, signature and power of procuration are optional roles that can be reported.
 







 
                                Board                            



A housing cooperative must have a board consisting of a leader and at least two board members. In addition, deputy board members may be elected. The general meeting elects the board including the leader. This means that the board cannot elect its own leader.
In addition, the statutes may stipulate that the house building cooperative to which the housing cooperative is affiliated, can elect one of the board members.
When you are to register the board, you need to enclose

the minutes from the general meeting showing the election

New board members must sign the Coordinated register notification or enclose declarations of acceptance, which shows that they have taken on the assignment.










 
                                Auditor                            



A housing cooperative must have one or several auditors. The auditor has to be state-authorised. The general meeting elects the auditor.
When you are to register an auditor, you have to attach

the minutes from the general meeting showing the election
declaration of acceptance from the auditor, which shows that he or she has taken on the assignment.











 
                                Accountant                            



The housing cooperative can choose to have an accountant. If the cooperative housing has an accountant, you need to register this with us.
It is only possible to register authorised accountants who are registered in the Register of Accountants.
The accountant must confirm that he or she has taken on the assignment.










 
                                Business manager, general manager and contact person                            



As a main rule, a housing cooperative is obliged to have a business manager, unless otherwise is stipulated in the articles of association. The business manager may be a legal person, such as a limited company, or a natural person who is 15 years of age or older.
The housing cooperative may have a general manager, but only if they have a business manager as well.
If the business manager is a legal person or it is stipulated in the articles of association that the housing cooperative shall not have a business manager, the housing cooperative may decide to have a contact person.










 
                                Signature                            



Signature is an authorisation to act and sign on behalf of the cooperative housing in all circumstances.
Basically, the board jointly has signature. The board can assign signature rights to board members or a business manager, either separately or jointly.
If some of the board members have not signed the coordinated register notification, you must attach the minutes from the board meeting showing the decision of those who are to be assigned signature.










 
                                Power of procuration                            



Power of procuration is an authorisation to act and sign on behalf of the housing cooperative, associated with the daily operations. The proxy cannot encumber or sell the enterpriseâ€™s real property.
The board can issue power of procuration to one or more people. If there are several people, you must state whether they are empowered to use it separately or jointly. Limitations beyond this, for instance connected to time or amount, cannot be registered.
Powers of procuration can be withdrawn by the board at any time.
