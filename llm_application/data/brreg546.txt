Check what else you need to remember when closing down your sole proprietorship.
Closing a sole proprietorship where the owner is deceased
When reporting closure for a sole proprietorship where the owner is deceased, it is not possible to submit the form electronically. In these cases you must use the paper form for striking off an enterprise.
If the sole proprietorship is registered in the Register of Business Enterprises, a notification about the closure must be signed by a person representing the estate. You must attach a certificate of probate or a certificate of probate relating to undistributed martial property.
If the sole proprietorship is not registered in the Register of Business Enterprises, a notification of closure can be signed by relatives or an official receiver. No attachments are required.
