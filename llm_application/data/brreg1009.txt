Questions about the app My hunting documentation
 







 
                                How can I use the app?                            



The new app can provide you with the hunting licence fee card and the big game hunting diploma in one place.
By bringing this app on the hunt, you have everything you need to document that you have paid the hunting licence fee and that you have passed the shooting test. If you are being controlled, it is sufficient to show the QR code in the app.










 
                                Where do I find the app?                            



You download the app through the Google Play shop or the App store.
For further information about the app, please look at our guide for the shooting test.










 
                                Will the app work without coverage?                            



Yes, as long as you have logged in to the app for the first time with coverage.
In order to get the last information that the app has retrieved from the Register of Hunters, you need to remember your personal code.










 
                                How do I receive a diploma of the big game test in the app?                            



Please look at our guide about how to take the shooting test on your mobile.

Questions about the hunting licence fee and payment

Everyone who is going to deal with hunting and trapping in Norway must pay a hunting licence fee. This fee applies for an entire hunting year (from 1 April to 31 March). Pay the hunting licence fee through our payment solution.
Paid hunting licence fee does not provide hunting rights in any area. You must also have permission from the landowner or the licencee to conduct legal hunting.

You must pay an additional fee for moose, red deer and wild reindeer.










 
                                What can I do when I have paid the wrong amount or paid several times?

Questions about the hunting licence card
 







 
                                I forgot or lost my hunting licence card. What can I do?

Once you have passed the test, you will be notified in Altinn that you are registered in the Register of Hunters. Pay the hunting licence fee, and you will find the hunting licence card on My hunting profile.
Please note that the hunting year starts on 1 April. Do not pay before the hunting year has started, unless you intend to go hunting earlier.
If you have passed the test earlier this year, and you go hunting before 1 April, you must pay the hunting licence fee for the current hunting year.

If you have paid the hunting licence fee, you must report hunting and trapping yields. The deadline for reporting is on 1 May.
This will be in addition to reporting to the landowner, mountain authorities or others, such as the State forest, or the Finnmark property.
If you have not submitted the report within 1 May, you will be charged an additional fee.
The additional fee is in addition to the payment for the next year’s hunting licence fee.










 
                                How do I report hunting and trapping yields?
