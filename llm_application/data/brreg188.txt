How to fill in the form
In order to register a marriage settlement you must use an approved form. You will find this in our form directory. Here we show you how to fill in each separate field in the form.
Submitter
You must fill in all the fields, but if you do not have a customer number with us, you can submit the form without one.
Information about spouses or partners
You must fill in all the fields. If one of you do not have a Norwegian national identity number or d-number, you must attach an application for a d-number.
Marital status
Tick one of the options.
Agreement of
Tick options 1, 2 or 3.
Option 1 – if this is your first time creating a marriage settlement together.
Option 2 – if you have previous marriage settlement(s) and want to revoke everything you have agreed upon in the past. Then only this new marriage settlement will apply.
Option 3 – if you have previous marriage settlement(s) and want to change or supplement what you have previously agreed upon. The agreements in previous marriage settlement(s) will then come in addition to the new marriage settlement.
 







 
                                Gift                            



Tick here if you want to give each other a gift. The gift must be owned by the one who gives it away at the point of time you enter into the marriage settlement. Ordinary household contents in a common home provided for future use, can still be given as a future gift.
You must specify the gift and who is to be the donor and the recipient. You do this on page three as supplementary text.










 
                                Separate property                             



Tick one of the options.
Joint separation of property
You choose this if everything you own now and what you later acquire should be separate property. The value of all the assets will then be kept beyond partition when the marriage ends and nothing will be joint property. Here it is not necessary to specify what you own on page three.
Partial separation of property
You choose this if only some of the assets are to be separate property. It must be clearly stated on page three of the form what is to be separate property and to whom it applies. The separate property can be stated in many ways, such as in fractions or percentages. You cannot have separate property of assets belonging to the other owner.
If there is not enough space on page three of the marriage settlement, you can attach a list of all the assets that should be separate property. This must be signed by both of you.










 
                                Separate property alive, joint property upon death                            



Here you can only tick if you have agreed to separate property in this marriage settlement or in a previous marriage settlement. If you choose that separate property becomes joint property upon death, it means that the agreement of separate property terminates upon death. This will apply no matter who dies first.
You can also choose that separate property ends if one particular dies first. Then you must tick one of the two other options. If you use our form that does not have this tick option, you can specify this on page three of the form.










 
                                Undivided possession of separate property                             



Here you can only tick if you have agreed to separate property either in this marriage settlement or in a previous marriage settlement. If you tick that both have the right to retain undivided possession of estate with the other’s separate property, this means that the longest surviving spouse takes over everything you own together and the distribution of the deceased’s estate will be postponed.
You can also choose that only one of you should have the opportunity to retain undivided estate with the other’s separate property. Then you must tick one of the two other options. If you use our form that does not have this tick option, you can specify this on page three of the form.










 
                                Joint property                            



Tick one of the options.
If you in a previous marriage settlement has agreed to separate property and want to restore joint property for the entire separate property, you should tick option 1.
If you in a previous marriage settlement have agreed upon separate property and want to restore joint property for parts of the separate property, you must tick for option 2. You must specify what is to be converted to joint property. You can do this on page three of the form.










 
                                  Joint property – exemption from unequal division                             



If you both want to renounce the right to unequal division of joint property, you tick that the assets should not be unequally divided.
If only one of you wants to renounce the right to unequal division of joint property, tick one of the two other options. If you use our form that does not have this tick option, you can specify this on page three.
You can decide that part of the assets should not be unequally divided, that the unequal division of the assets should be divided equally if the division occurs after a certain point of time or if you have children together. You must specify this on page three of the form.










 
                                Joint property – unequal division alive, equal division upon death                             



If you both want to agree that the unequal division of property should be equally divided upon death, tick option 1.
If you want the agreement to apply if one particular dies first, you must tick for one of the two other options. If you use our form without this tick option, you can specify this on page three.




Signatures
All the pages of the marriage settlement must be signed by both spouses. In addition, two witnesses should confirm the signatures on page four. This is a requirement in accordance with section 54 of the Marriage Act.
Everyone can sign at the same time, or you can confirm your signatures when the witnesses sign. If only one of you benefits from the marriage settlement, it is sufficient that only the other spouse signs. The requirement for witnesses is nevertheless the same.
The witnesses must be on age, accepted by both of you and know that a marriage settlement is to be entered. They do not need to know the contents of the marriage settlement.
