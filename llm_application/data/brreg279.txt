About the Register of Hunters

Last updated: 27 October 2021.





The Norwegian Register of Hunters registers those who are licensed to go hunting in Norway.

The Norwegian Register of Hunters was established in 1982 by the Directorate for Nature Management, now called the Norwegian Environment Agency. They operated the register until March 1999, when this operation was transferred to the Brønnøysund Register Centre.
The tasks carried out by the Norwegian Register of Hunters primarily include registration of hunters who have passed the hunting test and issuing the form for hunting licence fee. The register also provides an overview of the registered hunters who have paid the hunting licence fee and information about persons who are sentenced to loss of hunting rights for a shorter or longer period.
The Norwegian Register of Hunters has online solutions for payment of the hunting licence fee and licensed hunting. These solutions can be used by Norwegian or foreign hunters registered in the register.
Hunter information about game, hunting seasons, weapons and ammunition, is handled by the Norwegian Environment Agency.
