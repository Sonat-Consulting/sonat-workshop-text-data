How to be registered?
If you are an association or engaged in voluntary activity, you often need an organisation number to open an account with the bank, Vipps or similar. You will receive this by registering as an association in the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities.
There are many types of associations, such as sports clubs, scouting associations, Christian organisations, car owners’ associations, political parties, workers’ associations or those engaged in music, theatre and various other voluntary activities.
What is an association?
An association is a self-governing association with members. The association is to promote purposes of common interest, which may be of a humanitarian, political or similar nature. Associations are governed by the members.
What can we not register as an association?
If you are owners or unit holders, or if the fortune and the debt can be distributed to the members, you must consider other organisation types than association. Here you will find information about other organisation types.
Can the association be registered in the Register of Non-Profit Organisations?
If the association is engaged in voluntary activity, you can also apply for registration in the Register of Non-Profit Organisations. Then it will be possible to participate in the grassroot allotment programme, or apply for VAT-compensation.
Do we need to register in the Register of Business Enterprises?
Only associations operating with business activities can register in the Register of Business Enterprises. Upon registration in this register, the association will receive a certificate of registration. Registration in the Register of Business Enterprises is subject to a fee. See fee overview.
