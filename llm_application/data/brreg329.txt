Revoking a merger

Last updated: 6 November 2021.





The decision to merge can be revoked by the same executive body that made the decision. 

The revocation has to be approved by all the acquired companies or the acquiring company.
The following documents must be attached

minutes from the general meeting showing the decision to revoke the decision to merge, alternatively minutesÂ from the board meeting if the board has approved the merger plan pursuant to special legislation.

Once we have approved notifications about mergers, we will send feedback and a certificate of registration in the post.
