Closing a foundation

Last updated: 28 February 2022.





A foundation must first report a dissolution before it can be closed. 

Dissolution is also called liquidation. The result of this process is that the foundation ceases to exist as a separate legal entity, and that it will be deleted both from the Foundation Register, the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities and the Register of Business Enterprises.
When a decision about liquidation has been made, the Foundation Autority must elect a liquidation board for the foundation. The foundation must suggest members to the liquidation board. You can read more about how to report a dissolution of a foundation at the website of the Gaming and Foundation Authority.
