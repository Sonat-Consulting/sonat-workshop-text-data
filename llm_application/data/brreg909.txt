If you are to be registered with a role, such as owner or general manager and do not previously have a national ID number or a d-number, you may apply for this at the same time as you submit the Coordinated register notification.
You must submit the Application for a d-number, BR1015E, by post with a certified copy of the credential and the Simplified form for sole proprietorships with attachments.
A guide telling you how to fill in the form is included in the application form.
Change in requirements from 10 June 2020
Persons with d-numbers who are to be registered as owner of a sole proprietorship must meet at the Tax Office for ID verification before registration.
This applies both to persons with prior d-numbers and persons applying for d-numbers in connection with the registration.
You will find additional information about d-numbers and ID-verification on the Tax Administration’s website.










 
                                Description of the business                            



You must provide as accurately as possible a description of the activity of the business. It is not sufficient to state a general description. Therefore, you must state what may be produced/ sold or what services/activities will be carried out.
Here are some examples of how detailed the description must be:

Agriculture: Growing of cereals. Raising of dairy cattle
Transport: Freight transport by road. Taxi operation.
Trade: Retail trade with groceries. Online shop with sports equipment.
Industry: Production of musical instruments. Manufacture of furniture. Manufacture of gold and silverware.
Building and construction: Groundwork, Plumbing. Painting.
Consultancy activities: Business consultancy. Technical advisory service in the oil sector. Advisory service in engineering and construction. Architectural activities within construction.

If you operate activities in multiple branches, you must specify each of them according to the size of the turnover or employment.
In the form Coordinated register notification, you must confirm that the information provided about the activity, meets the requirements for business operations.
The business description forms the basis for the enterprise’s industrial code. Here you can read more about industrial codes.
