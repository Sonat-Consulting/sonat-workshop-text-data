Apply for remission of late filing penalty or exemption from joint liability

Last updated: 8 February 2023.





It is possible to apply for remission of the late filing penalty or exemption from joint and several liability. Joint and several liability means that several persons are personally liable for the same claim. 

The late filing penalty must stop accruing before you can apply for remission or exemption. You cannot appeal the levied fine or decline it.
The application must be in writing. You must explain why complete annual accounts were not submitted to the Register of Company Accounts within the deadline, and you must document the causes to remit the penalty fee.
You must pay the late filing penalty even if you apply for remission or exemption.
Terms of remission or exemption from joint liability
The Register of Company Accounts will assess whether the reason meets the requirements beyond the accountant’s control, or within special reasons. The terms are strict and it is difficult to be remitted the late filing penalty or to be exempt from the joint and several liability. There are only in extraneous circumstances that we can remit the late filing penalty in whole or in part. The same terms apply to exemption from the joint and several liability.
 







 
                                Grounds leading to remission or exemption                            



Examples of such causes are

acute or severe illness
data casualty
seizure of accounting material
fire
theft
COVID-19 (applies only to the accounting year 2019 and 2020)











 
                                Grounds that do not lead to remission or exemption                            



Examples of such causes are

ignorance of laws and rules concerning
age
illness with only one of more persons with joint and several liability
when the board post is a formality
insufficient receiving of a reminder to submit annual accounts
little or no activity in the enterprise
that the enterprise is under liquidation
that the enterprise has a charitable pupose, is run by voluntary work or does not conduct business activities
misunderstandings and other internal affairs between you and your accountant or auditor
poor economy in the enterprise
that the late filing penalty is unreasonably large
high workload





Conditions beyond the accountant’s control
For the terms to lead to remission or exemption, you must document that unexpected condtions arose that were beyond your control in the role of responsible for the enterprise. You must also have done everything possible to comply with the submission obligation. Besides, there must be a connection between what happended and that the annual accounts were not sent within the deadline.
Special reasonableness
The terms apply when it becomes completely unreasonable to maintain the late filing penalty. This occur only in very special cases.
