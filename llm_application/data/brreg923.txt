Confirmation of share capital contributions

Last updated: 3 February 2023.





Upon registration of a new limited company and by an increase of the share capital that doesn't happen by bonus issue, you must attach a declaration from an auditor, a financial institution, an attorney or an accountant which confirms that the share capital has been received by the company.

A financial institution, an attorney or an accountant can only provide the confirmation if the share capital is issued in cash.
The confirmation must include:

information on the contributed amount issued in cash, stating that it is in regards to share contribution
the business name of the company the confirmation involves
the date
the signature of the person which issues the confirmation
the name of the financial institution, the auditor, the attorney  or the accountant providing the confirmation

It is not sufficient to enclose a receipt or a bank statement.
 







 
                                Electronic submission of confirmation                            



The confirmation must be signed electronically if the notification to the Register of Business Enterprises has been submitted electronically. Therefore, it is not necessary to date and sign it otherwise.
When you have uploaded the confirmation, you have to enter the organisation number of the auditor, the financial institution, the attorney or the accountant who drew up the confirmation. They will  then receive a signing task in their inbox, which they have to enter and sign before the notification can be submitted.
If you want to read  more about electronic signing, you can do that on the page “Coordinated register notification”. You will find it under “Useful links” on your right side.
