What should the annual accounts contain

Last updated: 10 May 2023.





Here you will find an overview of what the annual accounts must contain.


profit and loss account

The income statement to the Tax Administration will not be approved as profit and loss accounts and balance sheet.
The annual accounts and attached documents will be published. Therefore, you must not enclose documents that contain sensitive information.
If the enterprise is a parent company in a group, the annual accounts must also contain

profit and loss account for the group
balance sheet for the group
notes to the annual accounts for the group
statement of cash flows for the group (do not apply to small businesses)
auditor’s report for the group (if the group has auditing obligation)

If the group in its entirety complies with the rules of small businesses, you do not have to prepare and submit consolidated accounts. There are several exemptions to preparation of consolidated accounts. If in doubt, contact an accountant or an auditor.
You must use the correct form for annual accounts. All the attached documents must be clearly legible and you must submit all in one operation.
You also have to enclose a dispensation from the Directorate of Taxes if:

the annual accounts are not in Norwegian
the exemption from preparing a separate consolidate accounts has been used, and the parent company is domiciled in another state or EEA-state.
