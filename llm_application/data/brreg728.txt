Registering several sole proprietorships

Last updated: 30 August 2022.





If you want to register more than one sole proprietorship, two terms must be met:

Each of the sole proprietorships must be considered as self-employed
The businesses must be at different geographical locations or be in different lines of business.

You must confirm that the stated information about the activity, meets the requirements for business activities. As an alternative to registering several sole proprietorships, you can choose to expand the business of your existing sole proprietorship. You must then change the information that is registered with us. You do this by submitting the Coordinated register notification.
Self-employment
In assessing whether a sole proprietorship operates independent commercial activity, emphasis is placed on

what activity the business operates and its scope
how much time is spent in running the business
the amount of work devoted to it
how large the financial turnover is

Activities that are considered to be purely one-off events or hobbies are not defined as commercial activity.
Different geographical locations
When we consider whether the business operates at different locations, the business must be physically located at different locations.
