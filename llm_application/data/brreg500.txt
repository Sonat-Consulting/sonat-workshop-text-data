Coordinated register notification








In the first step you notify the decision to dissolve the enterprise. When the creditor deadline of six weeks has expired, you may send a notification of final closing.
 







 
                                Dissolution                            



When reporting a dissolution, we announce a creditor notice and tell the creditors to report their claims to the chair of the liquidation board.
The decision of dissolution must be made by two consecutive general meetings with at least four weeks’ intervals. One must be an ordinary general meeting. The general meeting must also elect a liquidation board. The liquidation board replaces the board and the general manager. New board members must confirm that they have taken on the assignment.
You must enclose

minutes from both general meetings showing the decision of dissolution and election of the liquidation board.











 
                                Closing                            



After the creditor deadline of six weeks and the distribution has been terminated, the audited settlement must be presented to the general meeting. Once the settlement is approved, you can strike off the house building cooperative with us.
You must enclose

minutes from the general meeting stating that the audited settlement has been presented and approved











 
                                Revoking the dissolution                            



The general meeting may revoke the decision to dissolve, if at least half of the unit holders vote in favor, and the partition or payment to the unit holders has not taken place.
You must report the revocation to the Register of Business Enterprises quickly.
Upon revoking, the general meeting must also elect an ordinary board, and auditor if this is missing.
You must attach

minutes from the general meeting showing the decision to revoke the dissolution and election of the board and auditor, if any

If new board members are elected to the the board, these must confirm that they have taken on the assignment. They do this by signing the notification.
You must also report a new general manager, since the enterprise does not have this role during the dissolution.
