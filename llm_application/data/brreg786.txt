D-number

Last updated: 4 November 2022.





D-number is a number assigned to foreign nationals without a Norwegian national identity number, in need of some kind of identification to Norwegian authorities. 

We can only request a d-number in cases where a d-number is required in connection with registration of role holders in the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities and the Register of Business Enterprises or in connection with registration of marriage settlements.
Due to requirements for verification of identification documents upon assigning a d-number, the application must be submitted on paper.
 







 
                                Do you need to be registered in the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities or the Register of Business Enterprises?                            



If you are to be registered with a role, such as the chair of the board or contact person and do not previously have a national ID number or a d-number, you may apply for this at the same time as you submit the Coordinated register notification.
You must submit the Application for a d-number, BR1015E, by post with a certified copy of the credential and the paper version of the Coordinated register notification with attachments.
A guide telling you how to fill in the form is included in the application form.
Change in requirements from 10 June 2020
Are you going to be registered as owner of a sole proprietorship? Persons with d-numbers who are to be registered as owner of a sole proprietorship must meet at the Tax Office for ID verification before registration.
This applies both to persons with prior d-numbers and persons applying for d-numbers in connection with the registration.
You will find additional information about d-numbers and ID-verification on the Tax Administration’s website.










 
                                Do you need to register a marriage settlement in the Regiter of Marriage Settlements?                            



If you or your spouse do not have a national ID-number or a d-number, you can apply for this at the same time as you submit the marriage settlement for registration.
Submit the marriage settlement by mail along with the form Application for a d-number, BR1015B and a certified copy of the credential.
A guide telling you how to fill in the form is included in the application form.










 
                                Do you need a d-number for other purposes?                            



If you need a d-number for purposes other than registration in one of our registers, you must contact the enterprise which initiated or required the d-number. We cannot request a d-number for other needs than upon registration with us.
Read more about who has the authority to request a d-number at the website of the Tax Administration.










 
                                What does the identification document have to contain?                            



The identification document must contain

name
date of birth
photo
gender
nationality
date of expiry

Normally a passport or a national identity card will contain the required information as mentioned above. It is important that the machine readable strip at the bottom of the passport shows on the copy of the passport. The reverse side of the ID-card usually contains a machine readable strip. Therefore, you must also attach a certified copy of the reversed side.
The main rule is that the identification document must be issued by a public authority.










 
                                Who can certify a copy?                            



A copy may be certified by

a Norwegian public authority
a Nordic police authority
a Norwegian lawyer
a Norwegian state authorised or registered auditor
a Norwegian authorised accountant
a foreign enterprise with notary powers

Anyone who certifies the copy must stamp and sign on it. We cannot accept a copy of the stamp and signature.










 
                                Do you alreday have a d-number?                            



If you already have a d-number, this is to be used in connection with registrations
If you do not have access to or have questions about your d-number, you may contact the National Registry at the Tax Administration.
The National Registry submits a confirmation of your d-number after this has been assigned. The confirmation will be submitted by post to the address you are registered with in the National Registry.
