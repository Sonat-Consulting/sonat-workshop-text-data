User forum

Last updated: 3 February 2023.





The user forum is an arena where representatives from the Register of Business Enterprises and the users' interest organisations meet.

 


The forum is to be mutually beneficial for both parties. Here, the parties may contribute with constructive input and debate, which in turn results in more user-friendly and efficient agency.
We hold meetings three times a year, with the main gathering in Brønnøysund in June, and follow-up meetings in Oslo in October and March.
