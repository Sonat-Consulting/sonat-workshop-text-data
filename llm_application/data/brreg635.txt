This is us

Last updated: 16 August 2022.





The Brønnøysund Register Centre has 17 registers, as well as several other services. 

The information from our registers is used in both the public and the private sector. The result is a more efficient and productive society because we make thing easier.
Other businesses use data from our registers upon developing their own services.
