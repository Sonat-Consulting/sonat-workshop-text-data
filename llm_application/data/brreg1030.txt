Data about signature and power of procuration

Last updated: 13 April 2023.





The service consists of two APIs: The inquiry service and the control service.

The information about signature right and power of procuration is retrieved from the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities and the Register of Business Enterprises, and is structured through the interpretation of 17 different rules, based on the most frequently used signature rights and powers of procuration.
The inquiry service
In this service you will find the names and birth dates of the general manager, the board of directors and the persons in the enterprise who has the right to sign and the power of procuration.
The API for the inquiry service is open and free of charge.
Public authorities and credit inquiry agencies will in addition, through the use of an enterprise certificate, retrieve information about national identity number for the persons who have the right to sign and the power of procuration.
The control service
The control service requires the use of an enterprise certificate, but is free of charge and available to everyone. Here you fill in national identity number and organisation number, and will retrieve information about whether the person has the right to sign on behalf of the enterprise.
Here you will find documentation for the APIs and information on how to gain access.
