Starting the company
When you are going to start a limited company, you must first establish the company.
In order to start a limited company, you must create a memorandum of association. Before you do this, it would be a good idea to figure out who to join the company’s board, as well as choosing its business name. You must also consider whether the company needs to have an auditor and who this should be.
Board and name of the company
A limited company must have a board consisting of at least one member. The election of the board must be stated in the memorandum of association. The founders must also decide the name of the company. See information about choice of name.
Does the company need an auditor?
If the company chooses to have an auditor, this must be stated in the memorandum of association. Some limited companies may choose not to have its annual accounts audited, assumed that certain criteria are met. We call this to waive audit. Please note that you must submit the annual accounts to the Register of Company Accounts even if it is not required to be audited.
