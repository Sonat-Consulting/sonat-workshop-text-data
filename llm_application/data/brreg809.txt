Electronic registration of mortgage documents

Last updated: 21 November 2022.





Only customers with computer systems can register documents electronically in the Register of Mortgaged Movable Property. There is yet no solution for electronic registration for individuals or others who do not have a computer system. 

Submission must be done from an external computer system, for example, by banks and financial enterprises. Thus, private individuals or others without such systems cannot submit mortgage documents electronically.
Those who are going to use the solution must themselves provide for the development and adaptation of their computer system.
