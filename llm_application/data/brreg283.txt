About the Register of Reporting Obligations of Enterprises

Last updated: 27 October 2021.





The Register of the Reporting Obligations of Enterprises maintains a constantly overview of business duties and provides opportunities for coordination and simplification.

The main task of the Register of the Reporting Obligations of Enterprises is to keep an ongoing  overview of the reporting obligations for business and industry, and to find ways to coordinate and simplify these obligations.
The register is primarily intended as a management tool for public administration. The aim is to prevent the unnecessary compilation and registration of information, particularly for small and medium-sized companies.
In addition, the register will be a source of information about mandatory obligations for business and industry.
Reporting obligation for own business
Through the Register of the Reporting Obligations of Enterprises businesses can find information about what reporting obligations that apply to their own business, who to contact to receive a particular form or a specific guide and which agencies can access the information submitted. The register has a good overview of the information that the various registries and agencies require from the business owner. The information provided by each business operator is not registered.
Coordination
The Register of the Reporting Obligations of Enterprises compares forms from various public agencies. If two or more agencies ask the same questions for the same type of businesses, these authorities shall then collaborate so that the question is asked only once.
Under the Act relating to the Reporting Obligations of Enterprises, the public administration is obliged to report to the register on all mandatory obligations being imposed on the business and industry. These enterprise managers, and the managing ministry, can retrieve an overview of notified information about the possibility of corrections.
Reporting obligation for other authorities
The overview from the Register of the Reporting Obligations of Enterprises comprises only mandatory obligations related to governmental authorities. Eventually reporting obligations required by county and municipal authorities will not be included in the list.
