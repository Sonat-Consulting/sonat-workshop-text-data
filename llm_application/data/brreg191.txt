Do we need to register the marriage settlement?
Registration provides legal protection for gifts.
Marriage settlements containing gifts among spouses, must be registered in order to obtain legal protection. If the gift consists of real estate, you must register the marriage settlement with us and the Mapping Authority in order to obtain legal protection. When the gift you received obtains legal protection, you can be protected from the donorâ€™s creditors. Fee for registration can be found in our fee list.
You can register a marriage settlement that does not contain a gift. We will then save a copy of it with us. A registered marriage settlement is publicly available, and it is possible to order a copy of it. See overview of how to make an order and what it costs.
Although the marriage settlement can be created and registered before the entry of the marriage, it will not be put into effect before you are married.
