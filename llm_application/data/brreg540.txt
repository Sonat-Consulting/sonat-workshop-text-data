Internal

Better internal production processes
Better overview and control of resource use and waste or emissions from the business
Reduced risk of costly cleanup operations
Strengthened financial conditions through preparation of environmental risk and thus reduced uncertainty for financial collaborators, lenders and insurers.

External

Increased credibility in relation to employees, neighbours, politicians and environmental organisations
The business is being registered in the Brønnøysund Register Centre and in an EU register. Here purchasers can check suppliers.
Meet documentation requirements for environmental management competence for suppliers in connection with the set of rules for public procurements in Norway as well as the EU.
The business is entitled to use an EMAS logo together with a statement of participation. The logo can be recreated on letterheads, envelopes, invoices, packaging and general information materials, but not on products. The logo is common to all of Europe and is recognized in all countries.
EMAS will be a quality stamp that many will see as a prerequisite for cooperation.











 
                                How to register the organisation?                             



Organisations that wish to register with EMAS must

carry out an environmental survey
draw up an environmental management system and set goals for environmental performance
conduct internal audit of system
draw up an environmental statement (report environmental performance)
implement an external audit by an independent verifier (certification body), which also includes the environmental statement
apply for registration to the Brønnøysund Register Centre with assistance from the environmental verifier

In broad terms the EMAS scheme requires that the organisation makes a survey of the environmental situation by conducting a review of the environmental performance under the supervision of an accredited verifier, and to draw up an environmental report. Once the statement has been approved, the organisation can register in the EMAS register.
The organisation undertakes to carry out new environmental audits with intervals of at least every three years. At each audit, new approved environmental statement shall be prepared. In addition, the organisation will carry out annual, easier environmental audits.
Small and medium-sized organisations can extend the registration cycle from three to four years, and validate the environmental statement from each year to every other year under given conditions.
EMAS makes a check of the received notification as to whether the organisation or the area meets the requirements of the regulation. Further it will be verified whether the inspection is accredited for the business conducted by the organisation or in the area. The inspection will also comprise the three years limit for renewed registration and compliance with the approved environmental statement or annual update.
When the notification to the EMAS register has been approved, the Norwegian Environment Agency will be notified. The directorate has 14 days to come up with any objections to registration due to non-compliance with applicable statutory environmental requirements.
After the expiration of deadline, the area will finally be EMAS registered.  If the notification is okay, a proof of registration and confirmation will be submitted.
