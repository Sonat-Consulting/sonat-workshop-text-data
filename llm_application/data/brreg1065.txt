When you register a new party, you need to send several documents.
A declaration from 5000 eligible parliamentary election voters, stating that they wish to register this party name. The declaration must contain:

name (written with capital letters)
date of birth
address
the date and the signature of each person giving the statement

Template for obtaining statements in connection with a new party name
The articles of association of the party, which among other things must contain

the name of the party
information about which control organ may elect the party’s executive body

Minutes showing the election of the board

if the members are elected in different meetings, the minutes from all the elections must be attached

Minutes showing the election of the party’s executive organ based on the Political Parties Act

if the members of the party’s executive organ are elected in different meetings or by different organs, minutes or other types of documentation which shows all the elections must be attached.
if the party’s board registered in the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities is going to be the party’s executive organ based on the Political Parties Act, this must be stated in a separate attachment.
if the party’s executive organ is going to have a different composition than the board registered in the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities, this must be stated in a separate attachment. The attachment must contain name, national identity number and address of the board members and the deputy board members. If the members have different roles, such as chair, board member or deputy board member, this must also be stated.





For registered information to have taken effect in time for the election, the Register of Political Parties must have received and recorded the notification within 2 January in the election year.
The party has to be registered in the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities in order to register in the Register of Political Parties. You can submit a notification of registration in both registers at the same time.
You have to use the form Coordinated register notification in order to register in the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities and the Register of Political Parties. In the field “Other remarks/information” you must report that the association is to be registered in the Register of Political Parties. Here you must also specify which party name that is to be registered in this register.
Arrangements for the election
Answers to questions concerning the election process, such as requirement for polling lists, which deadlines apply, information about the parties’ support at elections and other information about elections is available in the Election Portal. The assignment of the Register of Political Parties is limited to registration of information about the political parties according to current regulations.
