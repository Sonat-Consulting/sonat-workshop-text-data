For internal partnerships, own rules apply for submission of annual accounts.

Internal partnerships are liable for accounting based on the type of organisation if he company

has sales revenues of more than NOK 5 million

one of the partners is a legal person with limited liability (for example AS, ASA, BA, SA, SF, BBL and BRL)

Internal partnerships cannot register in the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities and does not have its own organisation number. Therefore, you cannot use Altinn to submit the annual accounts.
