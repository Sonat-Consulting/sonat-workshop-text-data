                                How do I change my registered address?                            



You can report a new address by submitting the form Coordinated register notification.
New business address
The business address is the same as the enterprise’s visiting address. You must provide a Norwegian address, with street or road name and house number, as well as a letter, if any, or possibly a place name.
New postal address

                                How do I change the name?                            



You register a new name by sending the form Coordinated register notification. The name of the sole proprietorship must include the owner’s surname. It is the surname as registered in the National Population Register  that has to be used.
If the sole proprietorship is registered in the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities, the change is free of charge. Changes in names registered in the Register of Business Enterprises entail a fee.
If you change your surname in the National Population Register, for example, if you get married, please report a change of business name to us. You register a new name by submitting the Coordinating register notification. This change is free of charge. Additionally, if you make other changes to your business name, it will entail a fee.
On the page How do I choose a name for my company? you can read more about the choice of names and what considerations you need to take.

Once you have changed the business description/the line of business for your sole proprietorship, you must register these changes with us.  You do this by submitting the Coordinating register notification.
The description you state in the form is the basis for the industrial code your business will receive. It is therefore important that you provide as accurately as possible the activity of the business. Correct industrial code will then be assigned.

                                How can I change my sole proprietorship into a limited company (AS)?                            



You cannot register direct conversion from sole proprietorship to a limited company. You must therefore

register the new limited company
close down the sole proprietorship

For the conversion to be free of tax, the limited company must be formed and the Register of Business Enterprises informed of this during the period between 1 January and the end of June in the year of income, and tax deductions and employer’s contribution calculated no later than from 1 July. Read more about tax free conversion under Start and run business in Altinn.










 
                                Can a sole proprietorship change proprietor?                            



A sole proprietorship cannot be transferred from one proprietor to another. The reason is that the proprietor is identified through his or her enterprise and has full personal responsibility for its debts and liabilities.
It is only through undivided possession of an estate that a sole proprietorship can change proprietor.
