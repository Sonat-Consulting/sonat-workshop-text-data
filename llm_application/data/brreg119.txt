Security in boat

Last updated: 28 July 2021.





We have information about registered compulsory security in boats that are not registered in the Ship Register. 

You can check any security if you have the national identity number or the organisation number of the owner of the boat. You can order a certificate of security in our webshop to find this information. The certificate is free of charge.
We do not register security in boats registered in the Ship Register. You therefore need to check any security with them. You will find information on the website of the Norwegian Maritime Authority.
There is no registry of voluntary pledge in boats not registered in the Ship Register.
