If you wish to change the information registered for your club or association, you can do this by submitting the form Coordinated register notification.
 







 
                                How do I change the address?                            



You register a new address by submitting the form Coordinated register notification.
New business address/visiting address 
This is the street or visiting address of the association. Normally this is a street address or a place name in small town areas. If the association has its own premise/club house or gathering place, you normally use this address. In addition, you can register a postal address.
Remember that the statutes for association registered in the Register of Business Enterprises, must be changed if the association changes its business address to a new municipality.
New postal address 
If you wish to have the mail sent to a different address, you can report this as the postal address. You can register a c/o address, if the association does not have its own postal box marked with the name of the association. This ensures that the mail will be sent to the correct receiver. In the example below, the letter for the association is sent to the postal address of the contact person.

                                How do I change who sits on the board?                            



When the association has elected a new board, this must be reported through the form Coordinated register notification.
Remember to have the surname and the national identity number of the board members available before you start.
You have to attach

minutes from the annual meeting showing who is elected as the new board

For associations registered in the Register of Business Enterprises, newly elected board members have to consent to the registration by signing the Coordinated register notification.










 
                                How do I change who has a signature right?                            



You change signature rights by submitting the form Coordinated register notification.
You must either attach

minutes from the annual meeting
articles of association, or
minutes from the board meeting

The documentation must clearly state that a signature right has been assigned, and whether it is assigned “jointly” or “separately”.










 
                                How do I change who has power of procuration?                            



You change power of procuration by submitting the form Coordinated register notification.

                                How can I resign my role in the association?                            



All role holders can report their resignation. When you resign, you waive all the rights and duties that your role has. You have to notify us about your resignation through the form Coordinated register notification. Once the resignation is registered, both the association and you who resign will be notified.




Any minutes or other documentation related to changes, must be downloaded as attachments to the form Coordinated register notification.
