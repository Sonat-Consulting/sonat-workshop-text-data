Congratulations on your new company
As soon as your company is registered, it will be announced on our website.
Once the limited company is registered and has been assigned with an organisation number, you will receive a notice by SMS or email. We will send a certificate of registration to your inbox in Altinn. You can also at any time download the certificate free of charge on brreg.no.
Announcement of new registration always includes information about the company’s name, organisation form, organisation number, objective, business address and board. If the company has an auditor or general manager, the announcement also contains information about this. Here you can see the announcements.
After a few days we will send an invoice to the recipient upon registration. You will find the invoice in the inbox in Altinn.
