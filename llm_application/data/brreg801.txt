How do I cancel a lien?

Last updated: 21 November 2022.





If you wish to cancel a lien registered with us, we have made an effort to assist you with any concerns you may have.

Not anyone can request the cancellation of a lien, and there are different procedures depending on the type of lien.
 







 
                                Do you have a registered lien that should be cancelled?                            



Security interest, leasing or a mortgage deed for business operators
You must contact the person who has a security interest in the vehicle, often a bank. It is the one who has a security interest in the vehicle who has to submit a notification to cancel the lien.
Execution charge or seizure
You must contact the legal representative of the case. The legal representative is the one representing the plaintiff and having to submit the notification to cancel the lien. The plaintiff can also submit the form.
Nothing for distraint or distraint deduction (deduction of salary or benefits)
You must contact the legal representative or the execution and enforcement commissioner in the case. The latter will also arrange the deletion.
Debt settlement
You must contact the execution and enforcement commissioner and ask them to submit a notification to us in order to cancel the lien.










 
                                How long does it take to cancel a lien?                            



When you pay a claim with a registered lien, it will always take some time to complete the cancellation of the lien.  First, the pawn holder must submit a notification to us in order to cancel the lien. It usually takes from three to five working days counting from the day we receive the notification until the lien is cancelled. Once the lien has been cancelled, we will notify credit rating agencies about this.










 
                                Do you have a mortgage in real estate that you want to cancel?                            



You will find information about this on the website of the Norwegian Mapping Authority. They are responsible for the registration of real estate.










 
                                What happens if no one submits a notification to cancel the lien?                            



The Register of Mortgaged Moveable Property cancels liens automatically when the legal protection period has expired. For most types of documents, this occurs twenty years after the registration. Execution charges will automatically be cancelled five years after the registration. Information about distraint deduction is cancelled when the period of distraint expires. Nothing for distraint is cancelled three years after the distrainment has been held.










 
                                Are you a pawn holder or a plaintiff and are to cancel a lien?                            



Security interest and leasing
You must write on the original document that it is to be cancelled. You need to sign the document and submit it by mail.
If you do not have the original document, you can request deletion in a letter. In order to identify the case, the letter must include sufficient infomation.  Preferably, please state the journal number. Upon deletion of a security interest, you must also confirm that the document has not been transferred to a new mortgagee. You must sign the letter and submit it by mail.
Mortgage document for business operators
You must write on the original document that it is to be cancelled. You must sign the document and submit it by post.
If you do not have the original document, you must contact the Register of Mortgaged Moveable Property for information.
Execution charge or seizure
You can write that the lien should be cancelled on the certificate of mortgage that you received in connection with the mortgage. If there are multiple liens in the certificate of mortgage, please make sure that you write on the page with the specific lien information. If you do not have the certificate of mortgage, you can write a letter. The letter must contain enough information to show which case it concerns. Please specify the entire journal number. You must sign the document and submit it by post.
