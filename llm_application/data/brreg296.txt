New registry platform

Last updated: 27 October 2021.





One of our primary objects is to provide security, order and transparency for society by means of reliable information. 

17 different registers, operating in 14 different systems, are now going to be gathered into one common platform.
The most important reason for creating a new registry platform is to replace outdated technology and solutions before they are no longer operative. The oldest technology in use here today dates back to 1992. The new platform will be an important cornerstone for digital communication between industry, citizens and authorities.
We are now laying the groundwork for more automated case processing, with the most automated decisions possible. The solution must be able to handle approximately 240 different sets of rules, from general legislation such as the Freedom of Information Act to more specialised legislation, such as the regulations regarding grass root allotment.
The work on renewing the system includes all support systems and other functionality belonging to the various registers, such as customer register, the system for handling orders, subscription services, searching and statistics.
A more modern architecture and platform for case processing will also make it easier to achieve 100 per cent digital reception of information to the registers and 100 per cent digital availability from the registers.
