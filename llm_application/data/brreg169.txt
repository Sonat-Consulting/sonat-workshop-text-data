Registration of parents’ committee (FAU)

Last updated: 18 August 2021.





If you are to register the parents' committee (FAU) or the parents' council of the school or the day-care centre as an association in the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities, it must be established as an association. 

FAU is an executive body for the parents’ council at a school or a day-care centre, and is therefore not an independent association.
FAU has the right to register as an association in the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities if

you formally establish an association
no other conditions violate the association principles

It must be clearly stated from the memorandum of association that an association has been formed.
You must attach

memorandum of association showing that FAU is established as an association
statutes showing that you are organised as an association

How to establish FAU as an association?
If you wish to do so, you must hold a founding meeting. You then set up a memorandum of association that you enclose when submitting a notification to us.
The memorandum of association must contain

the date for the meeting
which persons were present
decision to form an association
approval of the articles of association
election of a board
any other matters dealt with at the meeting

Here you can see examples of statutes and memorandum of association.
Remember to customise the templates so that information about the name, objective and membership is appearing.
