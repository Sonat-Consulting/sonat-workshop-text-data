Foreign businesses that are doing business operations in Norway are obliged to register in The Register of Business Enterprises. Foreign businesses which are not doing business in Norway have the right to register in The Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities. It is the foreign business in the country of origin which is responsible for the business in Norway.

If you wish to make changes to the information registered on your NUF, you can in most cases do this by submitting an electronic version of the form Coordinated register notification. If there are changes or new information about the business in the country of origin, you cannot use an electronic form.

                                How to register the business in the VAT Register?

NUF that carries out commercial activities in Norway, and is taxable to Norway according to Norwegian domestic legislation, has accounting obligation and an obligation to submit annual accounts to the Register of Annual Accounts.
If the NUF, which is registered in the Register of Business Enterprises, has no accounting obligation, they must report this in writing for each fiscal year to the Register of Annual Accounts. On the page headed Reporting obligations for Norwegian registered foreign businesses, you will find more information about accounting requirements.










 
                                When does an auditing obligation take place, and when does it expire?                            



NUF with an accounting obligation has a duty to audit as of the year after passing NOK 6 million in operating revenues or 23 million in total assets.
If the business is subject to audit, the operating revenues must be below the limit one year before the auditing obligation expires.










 
                                How can I change an NUF into a limited company(AS)?                            



You cannot directly register a conversion from NUF to limited company. You must therefore

register the new limited company
close down the NUF

In order for the conversion to be tax-free, the limited company must be established and a notification about this submitted to the Register of Business Enterprises during the period between 1 January and the end of June in the income year. Tax deductions and calculated employer’s contribution must be made no later than 1 July.
