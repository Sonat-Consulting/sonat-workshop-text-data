                                How do I get a hunting licence number?                            



A hunting licence number will be assigned to you when you register in the Norwegian Register of Hunters. If you have lost the number you can contact the Norwegian Register of Hunters.










 
                                I am going to participate in licensed hunting (dispatching injured game), what do I need to do?                            



In order to do licensed hunting you have to:

be at least 18 years old
have paid the hunting licence fee for the current hunting year
register for a large predator licence in the Norwegian Register of Hunters
comply with reporting duties
bring your personal licence while hunting
bring documentation for valid shooting test during the hunt (if you are hunting with a rifle)

Registration for a large predator licence must be done for each specific carnivore species for each hunting year. This means that you need to re-register for each hunting year or if you wish to hunt other carnivore species. There is no fee for the registration.










 
                                When will I be deleted from the Register of Hunters?                            



If you have not paid the hunting licence fee for at least one of the past five years you will be deleted from the Norwegian Register of Hunters. If you want to hunt again you need to submit  documentation anew.
