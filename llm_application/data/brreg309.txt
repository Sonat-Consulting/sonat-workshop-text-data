Demerger by way of capital reduction













Liquidation demerger














Triangular demerger














Cross-border demerger














Revoking a demerger










The acquired company (the existing company) can transfer all its assets to two or several acquiring companies (liquidation demerger), so that the original company ceases to exist. Alternatively, the acquired company can keep some of the assets (demerger by way of capital reduction), while others are transferred to one or several other companies.
The acquiring company/companies can be established through a demerger or the assets can be transferred to an existing company by increasing the share capital.
