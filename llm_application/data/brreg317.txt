                                Decision to demerge                            



When you report demerger online in the form Coordinated register notification, there is one common form for all the companies involved in the demerger. If you are applying the old paper form, you must submit one notification of the demerger decision for all of the companies participating in the demerger. The acquiring companies established as a result of the demerger do not submit any notification until after the end of the creditor time limit.
You have one month to notify the Register of Business Enterprises about this decision, as from the time when the participating companies approve the demerger plan. If there are several existing parties involved in the demerger, the one month period starts at the point of time when the last company approves the demerger plan.
If the Register of Business Enterprises has not been notified about the decision within this time, the decision is annulled.
The following documents must be attached
The acquired company must attach

minutes from the general meeting showing the approval of the demerger plan, or alternatively the minutes from the board meeting, if the board has approved the demerger plan based on the regulations of the Limited Liability Companies Act, section 14-11b..

Any existing acquiring company must attach

minutes from the general meeting showing the approval of the demerger plan, or alternatively the minutes from a board meeting, if the board has approved the demberger plan according to board authorisation.
