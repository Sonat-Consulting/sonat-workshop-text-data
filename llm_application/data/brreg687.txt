Useful information about the application process

Last updated: 22 August 2022.





As soon as you have applied for a position with us, you will receive an e-mail confirming the receipt of your application. 

After the application deadline has expired, all applicants will be assessed. Relevant candidates will be contacted for an interview.
Published list of applicants
We prepare a public list of applicants. This provides information about the name, gender, municipality of residence and age of all the applicants for the position. There are very strict requirements for exemption from this list. If you do not wish your name to appear on the list, you must tick a box and give a reason when you apply. If we are unable to grant your request, you will be able to withdraw from the process.
Extended list of applicants
All applicants have the right to request to see the extended list of applicants. This contains information about the name, age, education and experience of all applicants for the position. It is not possible to be exempted from appearing on this list. The extended list of applicants is only available to applicants for the position.
Register your CV
You can upload your CV to our CV database. When you have registered your CV, you can also subscribe to job announcements. You will then be notified of vacant positions by e-mail.
