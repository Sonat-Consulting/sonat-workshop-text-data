For most non-profit associations, it is optional to register accounting information
If you choose to register such information, you will be required to submit annual accounts to the Register of Company Accounts every year.

If the association chooses to take on reporting of annual accounts, the end date of the fiscal year must be stated.
Please note that foundations, limitied companies and associations with a general accounting obligation in accordance with the Accounting Act, cannot make use of these special regulations. These must submit annual accounts to the Register of Company Accounts according to ordinary regulations.

Only central levels of non-profit organisations with several organisational levels (regional and/or local levels) are required to report affiliations to the Register of Non-Profit Organisations.
