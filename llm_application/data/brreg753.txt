Fully electronic case processing

Last updated: 29 September 2022.





More and more of the changes that you send to us will be registered fully electronically, and you will receive a response within an hour.

If you submit a change through the form Coordinated register notification, several of these will automatically be registered with us. Once the change is registered, you will receive an updated register transcript and certificate of registration, if any.

If you do not receive a reply within an hour
There are some changes which are not processed fully electronically, for instance if the notification contains attachments. The same applies if there is already a notification under processing by us, or if there are deficiencies related to the case. Upon notification of the implementation of a merger, you will not receive a response within an hour.
Most of those who submit notifications that are processed electronically, will receive a response within an hour. However, we have system updates during the day, that can affect how quickly you will receive a reponse. This means, for example, that if you submit on Saturday afternoon, you must wait until Monday before receiving a reply. In other matters, the case might have been processed manually by a case worker. Then you can check out our case processing times here.
