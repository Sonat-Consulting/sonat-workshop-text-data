Congratulations on your sole proprietorship
The sole proprietorship will be assigned an organisation number as soon as it is registered.
You will now receive a notification via sms or e-mail. We will send the register transcript to your inbox in Altinn, and if the proprietorship is registered in the Register of Business Enterprises, you will also receive a certificate of registration. The register transcript and the certificate of registration, if any, will always be available free of charge in our webshop. Here you can find the information registered for your sole proprietorship.
For sole proprietorships registered in the Register of Business Enterprises, the registration will be announced on brreg.no. The announcement for the registration of a new enterprise will always contain information about the enterprise’s name, type of organisation, organisation number, objective, business address and owner. If the enterprise has an auditor or a general manager, information about this will be included in the announcement. Have a look at the page for announcements.
After a few days we will send the invoice to the one stated in the form as the receiver. You will find the invoice in the inbox in Altinn.
Registration fee.
