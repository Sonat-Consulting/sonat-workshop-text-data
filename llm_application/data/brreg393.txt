About the Register of Bankruptcies

Last updated: 3 January 2022.





The Register of Bankruptcies contains information about estates in bankruptcy and compulsory liquidations estates.

The Register of Bankruptcies was established in 1993. The register contains key information about each estate, including who is or has been the general manager, the chair of the board and auditor of a registered enterprise, and whether the chair of the board or the general manager or owner has any positions in other enterprises at the time of the liquidation proceedings.
The Register of Bankruptcies was established as a means to uncover and combat white-collar crime. The Register of Bankruptcies helps official receivers, the police, courts and other interested parties to quickly obtain important information.
The Register of Bankruptcies may also provide information about persons who have been disqualified from running a business. A person may be disqualified if, due to improper business practice, he/she has been deemed unsuitable to found, manage or serve as a board member or a deputy board member of a new company.
Most information in the Register of Bankruptcies is available to the public for a period of five years after winding up the bankrupt estate. To obtain information from the Register of Bankruptcies you must submit an organisation number or Norwegian national ID number.
All commencements of bankruptcy are publicised on www.brreg.no. The announcements of completion of bankruptcy proceedings will be available online for one year for private individuals and three years for companies.
