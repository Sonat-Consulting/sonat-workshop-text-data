There is a limit in the number of hits in our search service, the limit is 5000 hits per search. If your search generates more than 5000 hits, you will be requested to limit your search even furter.
A good tip to avoid excessive searches is to search for short periods of time, not more than 3-4 days, and delimit the search according to announcement types.
