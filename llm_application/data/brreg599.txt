The power of attorney may be stated in the association’s statutes or as a separate minutes. Make sure that the reported signature right is in accordance with this.

If the association has an auditor approved by the Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway and registered in the Register of Auditors, information about this must be reported here.

                                17 Category                            



In this field you must provide information about the type of category that fits the activity of the association.

If the association operates in several types of activities, it is possible to report up to three ICNP categories. The categories must be ranked according to the scope of activity.
Example:
A community group is operating in various activities related to the local community in which it belongs, almost as a charity association. In addition, they perform quite a lof of theatre arrangements.
They report category like this:
6 100,Local development, ranked as number 1
1 100, Art and culture, ranked as number 2
If you want to change category information, you must state all categories that are to be registered. That is to say, categories previously reported and which are to remain registered, need to be re-entered.










 
                                18 Registration of articles of association                            



When the association is to be registered in the Register of Non-Profit Organisations for the first time, the articles of association must always be enclosed. The information in the statutes will be used to consider wether the association has the right to be registered.
Associations can choose to register their statutes. By doing this, others can easily gain access to the current statutes. This can help increase the association’s confidence.
If the association has chosen to register its statutes, a minimum of items of information is required:

the name of the association
objective
annual meeting
election of the board
change of articles of association
termination

Requirements for content can be found in section 6, second paragraph of the Register of Non-Profit Organisations Act.
Please note that there are separate rules for foundations and limited companies in this connection.
18.1 Registration of the articles of association
Tick off if you wish to register the association’s statutes. It is important to note that a commitment to register the articles of association, leads to an obligation to register all future changes of these. You can report this by submitting a notification about a change and enclose a new and updated articles of association. This obligation can be undertaken and waived later on.
18.2 Current articles of association is changed
If the association has chosen to register its articles, they have also undertaken an obligation to register changes/updates of these. When submitting a notification about changes of the registered information, please inform us that the current statutes have been changed/ updated here.
The updated articles of association must be enclosed.










 
                                19 The annual accounts in the Register of Non-Profit Organisations                            



Associations can oblige themselves to submit annual accounts. One reason to do this may be the desire to make their accounts available for others. Enterprises that have undertaken a reporting obligation for annual accounts, will appear as open and tidy, since the accounting information will be available to anyone through the Register of Annual Accounts.
Associations that choose to report its annual accounts, must submit these annually to the Register of Annual Accounts.
The requirements for submitting annual accounts are different and simpler than what is laid down in the Accounting Act. Further information about these rules is available in the regulations regarding the Register of Non-Profit Organisations. Note that associations with ordinary statutory duty according to the Accounting Act cannot make use of these special regulations. These associations are obliged to submit the annual accounts to the Register of Annual Accounts according to ordinary regulations.
If your  answer is  “Yes” to the question of whether the association takes on reporting annual accounts, you need to state the end date of the financial year.
If the accounting period changes, you must specify from which accounting year the change applies and the new closing date.
If the association no longer wishes to oblige themselves to submit annual accounts, they can submit a notification about this to the Register of Non-Profit Organisations.
In Altinn you can download the form for submission of annual accounts.










 
                                20 The grassroot allotment programme                            



Registration in the Register of Non-Profit Organisations is a prerequisite for receiving funds through the grassroot allotment programme.
Players using services from Norsk Tipping, may decide that up to five percent of the stake is to go to a particular association or another non-profit organisation.
The player can only choose between those registered in the Register of Non-Profit Organisations. If the association wants to participate in the grassroot allotment programme, tick “Yes” in this field.
Please note the following: If you tick “Yes” in this field, you confirm at the same time that your association is running an activity only at a local or regional level. Association which are umbrella organisations for local associations cannot participate in the grassroot allotment programme.
Associations that do not wish to participate in the grassroot allotment programme, can be reserved by ticking “No” in this field.
In addition, in order to participate in the grassroot allotment programme, the activity being conducted must be of a certain type. The limitations are mostly, but not exclusively, based on the categorisation registered with the Register of Non-Profit Organisations.
Detailed regulations
Associations with activity within at least one of the following categories can participate in the grassroot allotment programme
1 – Culture and recreation
2 – Education and Research
Organisations whose activity is solely within the main category education and research cannot participate in the grassroot allotment programme.
3 – Health
Can participate in the programme, but not organisations which run hospitals, psychiatric institutions, nursing homes or any kind of private health clinics.
4 – Social services
5 – Nature and environmental conservation
6 – Housing and local community
Cannot participate in the programme. Exceptions apply to charities that still have the right to participate

Cannot make use of paid advertising
Association receiving grassroot funds cannot use paid advertising to get players to give share to their association, cf. section 9, d of the Grassroot regulations. Nevertheless, all clubs and associations have the opportunity to publish in their own channels, stick up posters and distribute promotional cards and letters.
Fictitious association
It is not allowed to establish an association only to get paid grassroot funds, see section 9, e of the Grassroot regulations. In such cases, this kind of association can be required to repay the grassroot shares.
The grassroot allotment programme is managed by Norsk Tipping which can provide you with more information about this arrangement.










 
                                21 Account number                            



If you have ticked for the association to participate in the grassroot allotment programme, you must state the association’s account number, see section 3, e.
If the account number is not stated or incorrect, resulting in the payment from Norsk Tipping failing, the association will lose its right to receive accrued funds, see section 4, third paragraph, of the Grassroot regulations.
Others may choose to register their account number in the Register of Non-Profit Organisations. This makes it possible for those who may need it, for instance contributors, to easily find the association’s account number.










 
                                22 Other remarks                            



Here you enter information that cannot be reported in the other field of the form. Add a separate sheet if there is inadequate space.










 
                                23 Notification address                            



It is obligatory to register a notification address.
Only new enterprises have to register a notification address.
The notification addresses will be used by public authorities to notify the enterprise whenever important information is available in Altinn. The addresses will only be available for public authorities.
If you are going to change this information later, you have to do so in the enterprise’s profile in Altinn.
The enterprise must have at least one notification address.










 
                                24 Signatures                            



The notification must be signed if it is to be approved. Those who sign the notification confirm that the information provided is correct.
The decision of who is to sign this notification is made according to where the association is to be registered. If the notification only relates to the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities or the Register of Non-Profit Organisations, it must be signed by the general manager, the business manager, the contact person or the entire board.
If the notification concerns the Register of Business Enterprises, it must be signed by a person authorised to sign or all the members of the board.
