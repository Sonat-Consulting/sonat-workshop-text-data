About the Central Marketing Exclusion Register

Last updated: 27 October 2021.





The register makes it easier for private individuals to stop addressed advertising by mail or phone.

The Central Marketing Exclusion Register was established in 2001.This register allows a private individual to stop his or her address from being used for unsolicited direct advertising by mail or for telephone sales. All such exclusions are registered in a central register. Anyone distributing advertising aimed at private persons is obliged to update their lists from the Central Marketing Exclusion Register no later than one month prior to use.
Today a number of companies and organisations are engaged in marketing by directly addressing private customers using address lists. Much addressed advertising is sent out on the basis of these address lists and many people may find themselves on such lists against their wishes. Anyone who so wishes may be deleted from these lists, but on an individual basis this would require contacting each enterprise to have the name and address deleted.
The Central Marketing Exclusion Register simplifies the task
The register simplifies this task, as the general public needs only to contact a single register instead of many enterprises. You may nevertheless still receive advertising for products from your business associates.
