                                Accountant

A signature right is an authorisation to act and sign on behalf of the company in all matters.
The board of the public limited company always has the right to sign jointly. The board may additionally assign signature right to selected board members, the general manager or designated employees,  unless otherwise is stated in the articles of association. If there are several, the company can choose whether the authorisation should be given separately or jointly. Other limitations, for instance connected to time or amount, cannot be registered.
A signature right can be withdrawn at any time.
When registering signature rights, you must attach

minutes from a board meeting showing the assignment of the signature right. Alternatively, the entire board can sign the form,  and no attachment is required.

Power of procuration is an authorisation to act and sign on behalf of the company, associated with the daily operations
A person with power of procuration is called a proxy. A proxy cannot encumber or sell the company’s real property.
A proxy cannot assign his or her power of procuration to another person. A public limited company can issue power of procuration to one or more people. If there are several people, they may be empowered to use it jointly or separately. Other limitations, for instance connected to time or amount, cannot be registered.
Powers of procuration can be withdrawn at any time.
