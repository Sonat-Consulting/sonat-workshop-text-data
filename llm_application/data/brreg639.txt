Fill in and sign
You need to register the company in the Register of Business Enterprises.
To do this, use the form the Coordinated register notification. Once you have established the company electronically, you must use the link you have received in the inbox in Altinn. The Coordinated register notification will then be prepared so that you can easily complete the registration.
If you have not established your company through the online foundation, you must open the form the Coordinated register notification and fill it in yourself.
Deadline to submit the form
The deadline for receipt of notification about registration of the company, is three months from the date when the memorandum of association was signed by the founders.
Attachment requirements upon registration
A memorandum of association with articles of association was automatically created for you who founded the company electronically. If you did not make an electronic foundation, you must upload the foundation document together with the statutes yourself. Regardless of how you have established the company, you must upload a confirmation of paid-up share capital. In some cases, it can be appropriate to attach multiple documents. Here you can see an overview of the attachment requirements.
When the form is completed, the board must sign it electronically. We send a notification of this to everyone who is obliged to sign. You will find the notification in the inbox in Altinn.
