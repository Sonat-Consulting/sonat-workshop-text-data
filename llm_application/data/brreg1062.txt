Check liens on cars and other vehicles. You can also order documentation for this.






Find liens on vehicles













When you are thinking of buying a car, it is important that you check the vehicle for outstanding liens. If you buy a car that has a lien on it, at worst you risk losing your car if the person who has a mortgage in the car requires it to be compulsory sold or returned.
Check that the registration number is valid before searching for liens
We cannot verify that a registration number is valid. If you search for an invalid number, it will appear as if the vehicle exists and is free of liens. The Norwegian Public Roads Administration has an overview of valid registration numbers..
Remember the proof that there are no liens at the time of purchase
If there are no liens on the car, you ought to order a certificate of mortgage. This serves to prove that you were in good faith if a dispute occurs. A certificate of mortgage sent by e-mail is free of charge.
Frequently asked questions about liens
 







 
                                Do I take charge of the previous owner's debt if I buy a car with a lien?                            



No, the liability for the debt will remain with the person who raised a loan with a mortgage in the car, and will not be transferred to the new owner. If the former owner fails to repay the car loan, the loaner has a legal right to the vehicle which they will repossess and sell to cover the debt.










 
                                Why does not the amount of the lien decrease when I pay off on the loan?                            



We do not update the amount of the lien as you pay off on the loan. If you would like to know how much is left on the loan, you must contact whoever has a mortgage in your vehicle.










 
                                I have paid off the entire loan, why is not the lien cancelled?                            



After the loan has been paid off, it will usually take some time before the lien is cancelled. The Register of Mortgaged Moveable Property usually has three to five days’ processing time. You must contact the bank if the lien is not being cancelled.










 
                                I intend to lend money to a friend so that he can buy a car. What should I think about?                            



If you lend money to someone in order for him/her to buy a car, it will be a security for you if you register a lien in the car.

                                What does it cost to register a security interest?                            



See the list of charges for registration.










 
                                How do I cancel a lien?                            



If the lien concerns a security interest, leasing or a mortgage document for business operators, you can contact whoever has a mortgage in the vehicle (often a bank). It is the one who has a lien in the car who has to submit a notification of cancellation in order to remove the lien.
