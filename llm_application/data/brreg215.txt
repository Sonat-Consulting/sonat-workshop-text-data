Before you register a joint ownership
A joint ownership is not founded, since it is not a legal person, but arises when two or more own or use something together.
The document that confirms that there is a joint ownership, can therefore be a deed of transfer, a will or an agreement.
If you do not have such a document, the easiest is to use our template for a ownership agreement. Fill in the missing information.
We have two templates for an ownership agreement, one for ownership without a board and one for ownership with a board. Choose the one who suits you best.
