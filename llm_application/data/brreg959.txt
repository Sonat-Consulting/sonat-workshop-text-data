You can subscribe to all annual accounts data from the Register of Annual Accounts

The subscription service provides delivery of figures from the annual accounts in XML-format. The delivery includes auditor’s remarks. Your subscription can also comprise copies of annual accounts via TIFF.
The subscription includes all the annual accounts registered in the Register of Annual Accounts. This amounts to approximately 300,000 annually. Note that information about the shareholders or the salary of the general manager in the annual accounts is not registered by the Register of Annual Accounts.
