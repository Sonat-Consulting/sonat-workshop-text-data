Feedback on annual accounts

Last updated: 28 February 2022.





The enterprise receives the decision regarding the annual accounts in the Inbox of Altinn, with notification by e-mail or SMS. 

We will send an e-mail to the e-mailaddress that was stated in the form for annual accounts and to the contact information in Altinn. In order to open the decision in Altinn, you need to have installed the latest version of Adobe Reader.
When the annual accounts are approved, we will send the decision of the approval of the annual accounts to the enterprise. This will also be announced.
If the annual accounts are not approved, the refusal decision states what you must rectify before re-submittance. If the annual accounts have been submitted within the deadline, you will have two weeks to rectify without being accrued a late filing penalty. This does not apply when the annual accounts are submitted after the submission deadline.
