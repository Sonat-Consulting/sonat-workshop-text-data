International work

Last updated: 27 October 2021.





We cooperate with foreign authorities, organisations and companies at various levels.

We maintain a dialogue with Nordic countries whose registry work is similar to our own. We participate in the European Commission’s Expert Group, such as Company Law Expert Group, Business Register Interconnection System, EUGO, Business to Government Datasharing, Norwegian business information is available in the EU/EEA through the Business Register Interconnection System.
We participate in areas  within the EU/EEA for the exchange of expertise and the design of common methods and standards. The most important European arena for this is European Commerce Registers Forum (ECRF).
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has for a number of years contributed with professional help in the work of developing reliable public registers in other countries, as an important part of assisting in nation building and social development. The Brønnøysund Register Centre has played a significant part in this work in a number of countries.
We also administer information regarding Norwegian affairs relating to international agreements. For instance, Altinn is the Norwegian contact point for service providers in the EU/EEA. We have the equivalent obligations as a result of the Professional Qualifications Directive of the EU.
Here are some examples of our international projects
 







 
                                Nordic Smart Government                            



Smart Government is a Nordic cooperation which is principally about simplifying reporting regarding financial information from businesses by using accounting transactions as a starting point. This applies to reporting to public authorities and making information available to the industry.

euBusinessgraph is governed by Sintef, with six participant countries and ten organisations. The object is to make data available in order to develop services connecting this information across borders. Our main focus is primarily on open data, and a desire to develop such solutions in a way which is internationally sustainable.

                                TOOP (the once only principle)                            



TOOP is financed by the EU, and consists of participants from more than 20 countries and 50 organisations. In Norway, the Brønnøysund Register Centre is a national partner. The project looks into the possibility of sharing business information between authorities in various EU/EEA countries. The object is to avoid double reporting for the businesses.
