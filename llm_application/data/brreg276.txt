About the Register of Non-Profit Organisations

Last updated: 27 October 2021.





The Register of Non-Profit Organisations is a register of organisations that run voluntary activities.

It is free of charge and optional to register, but others may require registration in order to gain status as a non-profit organisation, and to participate in their benefits.
Main task
The Register of Non-Profit Organisations improves and simplifies cooperation between non-profit organisations and public authorities. The register is meant to ensure systematic information which can strengthen the legal basis of and the knowledge about non-profit activity, and lay the groundwork for public policies towards non-profit sector.
What and who can be registered?
Only organisations that run voluntary activities can be registered in this register.
Activities which are not based on profit are considered to be non-profit activity. Non-profit activity is run by

non-commercial associations
non-commercial foundations which do not distribute funds, or only distribute funds to non-profit activities
commercial foundations which only distribute funds to non-profit activities
limited liability companies that only distribute funds to non-profit activities

The following activities are not seen as non-profit activities:

activities organised by the public authorities
activities based on a co-operative model, which are comprised in the Norwegian Act on Co-operatives

What is the information used for?
Associations and organisations that are registered in The Register of Non-Profit Organisations may:

participate in the Grassroot allotment programme whereby participants in Norsk Tipping’s gambling games can donate 5% of their stake to a local non-profit organisation
receive a VAT refund, i.e. they can apply for a refund of VAT paid on purchased goods and services

The information is also used for statistics and research.
Who are the users of the register?

Both public and private actors who want an overview of enterprises that conduct voluntary activity in connection with, for example,  sponsoring, contributions and the like
Norsk Tipping which manages the Grassroot allotment programme
The Gaming and Foundation Authority which manages the VAT refund
Everyone who wishes to see who is registered in the register can do so. Make a search in the Register of Non-Profit Organisations. 

The history behind the establishment
The register was established in 2009 on the initiative of the non-profit organisations. Upon registration of information about the voluntary activity in Norway, the cooperation between non-profit organisations and public authoritites has been simplified and improved. The government’s Soria-Moria statement states: “It is important to reduce administrative work for non-profit organisations to gain more time for activity.
