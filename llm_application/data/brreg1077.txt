Industrial codes

Last updated: 31 May 2023.





The industrial code indicates the main activity of the enterprise, and is primarily needed by Statistics Norway (SSB) for statistical purposes.

Registering an industrial code
The Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities assigns an industrial code to a new enterprise and changes the code when an enterprise changes the description of its activity. For enterprises within finance, large companies/corporations and enterprises within the public sector, Statistics Norway assigns the codes, which are later transferred to the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities.
Most enterprises will only be assigned one code, and this code indicates the main activity of the enterprise.
Changing the industrial code – incorrect industrial code
If your industrial code is incorrect, you can change the description of the activity using the form Coordinated register notification in Altinn. Remember to describe the main activity first, as this will determine which code the enterprise is given.
Industrial codes
The industrial codes are primarily needed by Statistics Norway (SSB) for statistical purposes. The industrial code indicates the main activity of the enterprises, and is based on the Standard Industrial Classification. As from 2008 the standard in force is called SN2007 and is based on the EU  standard NACE Rev.2.
The standard is first of all a statistical standard. It forms the basis of the encoding of enterprises in the Business Register of Statistics Norway, and the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities, showing the enterprise’s most important activity. It is one of the most important standards in financial statistics, and makes it possible to compare and analyse statistical information both nationally and internationally, over time.
The structure of NACE
Main industrial area    – the first level identified by a letter code
Activity                           – the second level identified by a two-digit code
Main industrial group – the third level identified by a three-digit code
Industrial group           – the fourth level identified by a four-digit code (NACE code)
Industrial code             – the fifth level identified by a five-digit code
Example of the composition of the industrial codes
+ F Construction
–41 Construction of buildings
–41.1 Development of building projects
–41.10 Development of building projects
–41.101 House building cooperative
–41.109 Other development and sale of real estate
The letter code identifying the main industrial area is not part of the NACE code. In addition to the four-digit NACE code (the EU’s four-digit code) many codes are on a national level split by the use of a fifth digit.
The five-digit code used in Norway is called industrial code.
