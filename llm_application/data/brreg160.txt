You can subscribe to overviews of roles in operating businesses in the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities and the Register of.Business Enterprises. 

You can compile information from the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities and the Register of Business Enterprises or just one of these. This information will be delivered as two separate files showing the complete overview of roles. It is not possible to subscribe to role changes for a specific period.
The files contain information about the birth date. In order to be provided with files containing information about national identity number and gender, you will need a license for credit information services from the Data Protection Authority.
The information consists of: Organisation number, business date, birth date/national identity number/organisation number, name, role, address, postal code, postal area, country, elected by, liability, gender, date.
The role overview can be delivered daily, weekly or every month. If desired, we can agree upon less frequent delivery.
