Cross-border insolvency

Last updated: 22 December 2022.





When insolvency proceedings have been opened on a business abroad, it can be registered in Norway at the Brønnøysund Register Centre. 

This applies to both businesses that have a Norwegian registered foreign business as well as businesses that are not registered in Norway. The foreign insolvency practitioner arranges the registration in Norway.
Cross-border insolvency proceedings are announced at brreg.no
If the company in which proceedings have been opened is a Norwegian registered foreign business, the insolvency proceedings will be announced. You can find it by searching for the business’ Norwegian organisation number. The businesses that do not have a Norwegian registered foreign business are listed at our website. The list contains the names of the businesses in which insolvency proceedings have been opened.
Fill in the electronic form in order to register the insolvency proceedings
The appointed insolvency practitioner abroad must complete and submit the insolvency form to the Brønnøysund Register Centre electronically. A certified copy of the appointment of the insolvency practitioner, or a certificate issued by the appointing body, must be attached to the form. The confirmation must be translated into Norwegian or English.
End or change the insolvency proceedings
You must use the same form along with attachments in order to change the information or end the insolvency proceedings.
When the insolvency proceedings have been completed, the foreign insolvency manager or debtor can apply for terminating the registered information. The debtor must document that the insolvency proceedings have finally been completed. The petition and attachments must be in Norwegian or in English.
 

What is insolvency?
A company is insolvent when it is illiquid and inadequate. This means that the company has problems redeeming its financial obligations as they fall due, and the assets do not cover any debt it has.
A court may decide to open a bankruptcy order in a company that is insolvent, where the insolvency is not temporary.
Debt settlement or bankruptcy that has been made abroad, and which include a company’s total assets can be announced and registered in Norway.
