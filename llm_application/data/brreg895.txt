Last updated: 23 January 2023.





The Register of Beneficial Owners is still under development. The online registration form will be available during 2023 for most of the organisation forms. 

Worth knowing:
 







 
                                Does my business need to register beneficial owners?                            



Basically, everyone has to register whether  they have actual beneficial owners or not.
If a business subject to registration does not have beneficial owners, or beneficial owners cannot be identified, the form must still be submitted.
Check if your business must register beneficial owners.










 
                                What is a beneficial owner?                            



A beneficial owner is a Norwegian or foreign person who meet one or more of these criteria:


Owns more than 25 percent of the business
Example: Anna and Emma own a limited company together. Each of them owns 50 percent of the shares. Both are then beneficial owners.

Controls more than 25 percent of the voting rights in the business
Example: Jake only owns 20 percent of a limited company, but a provision in the articles of association means that he still has 50 percent of the votes at the general meeting.

Has the right to appoint or remove more than half of the board members in the business
Example: In accordance with the agreement/articles of association, certain share classes may provide the right to elect a given number of the company’s board members.

Influence/control in another way
Example: Oliver is the guardian of a person who is a beneficial owner.

You are a beneficial owner based on direct ownership or control and/or indirect ownership or control.










 
                                Beneficial owner based on direct ownership or control                            



When there is no business between you and the business subject to registration, you are a beneficial owner on a direct basis.
Example:











 
                                Beneficial owner based on indirect ownership or control                            



A person who controls a sufficient share of a business who in turn has sufficient control of the business obliged to register beneficial owners.
To be a beneficial owner, a person must indirectly control more than 25 percent at the first level, then control 50 percent or more at subsequent levels.
At the first level, the following rules apply:

ownership more than 25 percent
voting rights more than 25 percent
the right to appoint or remove more than half of the board
influence/control in another way

At all the other levels below apply:

voting rights 50 percent or more
the right to appoint or remove more than half the board

Businesses that are between the business subject to registration and the beneficial owners are called intermediate businesses.
A person can be a beneficial owner on an indirect basis in three different ways:

through an intermediate business
through intermediate businesses at several levels
through consolidation/merging of rights











 
                                How do I find the beneficial owners of the business?                            



Most of the beneficial owners will be identified in the business’ documents, such as the memorandum of association, the share register and shareholder agreements, Generally speaking, the information here will be sufficient to identify the beneficial owners.
The board is responsible for keeping information about the beneficial owners of the business.










 
                                What information do I have to submit?                            




full name
national identity number or d-number
If a beneficial owner does not have a national identity number or d-number, you must state the date of birth
country of residence
all citizenships

You must indicate whether you are the beneficial owner due to ownership, voting rights or the right to appoint or remove board members, or manage/influence in any other way.




Both the Register on Beneficial Owners Act and the Money Laundering Act use the term beneficial owners, but have slightly different criteria to identify a beneficial owner.
