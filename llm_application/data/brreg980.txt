Form an association
The association must be formed before it can be registered.
When you are going to form an association, you need to have a meeting. At least two persons must be present as founders. The minutes from the meeting is a memorandum of association. You must also create articles of association containing the rules of the association.
The easiest way is to use our proposal for a memorandum of association and articles of association. Here you enter the missing information, and adapt the articles of association to the association.

Has the association previously been founded?
If the association is already founded, a new meeting of incorporation is not necessary. If you do not have minutes from the meeting of incorporation, you must instead enclose the last annual meeting minutes, along with the form and the articles of association.
