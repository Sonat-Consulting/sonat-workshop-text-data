In most cases you may strike off your Norwegian registered foreign business by submitting the Coordinated register notification form.

You have to attach

minutes from those in the foreign business who have the authority to decide to close down the business in Norway

If the foreign business has been struck off the register in the country of origin, you have to attach a confirmation from the foreign business register, or the equivalent documentation.

It is not possible for everyone to use the electronic form
You need to have a general manager, Norwegian representative, board for the business in Norway or a person who is authorised to sign to be able to submit the form electronically to the Register of Business Enterprises.
If you need to submit the form on paper, you have to use the form Coordinated register notification – striking off an entity. You will find it under Useful links on your right.
