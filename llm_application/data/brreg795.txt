Coordinated register notification 









For instance, if you register a new limited company, an association or a sole proprietorship, this is the service you have to use. The same applies if you need to change the information regarding address, board members, name or telephone number on behalf of a registered enterprise.
The service is fully electronic. This means that attachments that must accompany the notification must be uploaded electronically, and that everyone who are to sign, must do so in Altinn.
Using the form Coordinated register notification gives many advantages

It is sufficient for one person to sign electronic forms
The response will be available in Altinn two hours after the case processing is done
Simple changes will be registered automatically as we receive them
For most of the notifications in the Register of Business Enterprises, the fee will be lower

Frequently asked questions
 







 
                                How do I register roles (general manager, board etc.)?                            



Fill in the national identity number (11 digits) and surname. Choose the correct role and press «Legg til».
It is important that you write the surname precisely the way it is registered in the National Registry. For persons with several surnames (for instance Smith Jones) only the last name must be filled in. If the names are connected with a hyphen (for instance Smith-Jones), you have to fill in both names.










 
                                What kind of attachments can I upload?                            



The solution will accept most types of formats for text processing, spreadsheet and graphics.
Note that the size of the file you upload must not exceed 10 MB. If you have several files/attachments, the total size must not exceed 20 MB.










 
                                How do I sign the notification and attachments?                            



The form Coordinated register notification is an online service where filling, uploading of file attachments and signing is to be done in Altinn. You can only use the solution if all attachments can be uploaded as files, and that those who sign the notification can do it in Altinn. The person entitled to sign the notification depends on organisation types and what the notification applies.
Who should sign?
The notification must always be signed by at least one person. The signatory must be one of the notifiables that may be

general manager
member of the board
owner
business manager
signature rights
contact person
Norwegian representative

The notification can also be signed by a person who has been granted the right to sign on behalf of the enterprise.
The deputy member can sign the notification only when they act for the board member.
If you change the board for a business registered in the Register of Business Enterprises, all the board members have to sign the notification.This also applies to board changes in foundations registered in the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities.
Private individuals
When the signatory is a person, the signature assignment for the form Coordinated register notification, will be sent to the person’s inbox in Altinn.
Enterprises
When the signatory is a legal person, such as an accountant or an auditor, the signature assignment for the form Coordinated register notification, will be sent to the enterprise’s inbox in Altinn.
The signature can then be done by persons with the role “Access Management” in Altinn. This role is automatically given to persons registered in the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities with the role

general manager
the chair of the board
owner
official receiver

If you have one of these roles, you can delegate the right “Signer of the Coordinated register notification” to other persons.










 
                                How can I send an attachment later?                            



There might be situations where you will be asked to send additional documentation while the notification is under processing
If so, you will receive a message in your inbox in Altinn, containing information about what is missing. This message will contain a link to the original form, enabling you to upload and send new attachments.
After you have pressed the link «Send inn mer dokumentasjon», you will be directed to the status page. Press the button «Last opp vedlegg», and this will open the page where you upload new attachments. After you have uploaded the attachments, you press the button «Gå videre til innsending».
If there is no need for an electronic signature connected to these attachments, you will be directed straight to the page where you submit the attachment. Then you press the button «Send inn». If you have uploaded attachments which require a signature, you send the attachments for signing. The attachments will be submitted to the Brønnøysund Register Centre once they are signed in Altinn.










 
                                	 How do I check the status of the notification?                            



Only the person filling out the form will be able to check the status of it
Log on to Altinn. You will find messages in connection with the submission and processing of the form Coordinated register notification in the Inbox of Altinn.

                                How can I give the right to sign an electronic form to someone else?                            



The right to sign can be assigned by the general manager, the chair of the board or the owner
In the first page, «Hva vil du gjøre?», you can assign the right to sign electronic forms to other persons, for instance employees, the accountant and/or the auditor. When a person has been assigned this right, the person will be able to sign electronic forms on behalf of the enterprise in question.
If the enterprise does not have a chair of the board or a general manager, the contact person, the business manager or the Norwegian representative will be able to assign the right.
