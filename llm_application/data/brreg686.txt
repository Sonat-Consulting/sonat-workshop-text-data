Exiting tasks and good arrangements

Last updated: 22 August 2022.





With us, you will work with many skilled and committed colleagues in an environment willing to learn. We work a lot in teams across subject areas. 

We are an informal group with a good working environment. Together, we will create the best services in order to make contact with the public sector easier. We need many skilled employees with various backgrounds and competences for this.
We need, among others, you who have expertise within:

Systems development, architecture, security, testing, operation and management
Information management
Law
Visual communication, UX design, interaction design and service design
Project and process skills
Digitalisation, innovation and business development

Inclusion and diversity
Diversity is a strength for us. We want employees with different skills, subject combinations, life experience and perspectives in order to contribute to a better task solution. If you need any adaptations, we will arrange that.
If you have a disability, gaps in your CV or an immigrant background, this does not prevent you from having the right skills. Tick this in the application. Read more about the requirements in the Employer Portal.
Good arrangements
 







 
                                Favourable working time arrangement                            



We offer flexible working hours with favourable opportunities for time off in lieu. We have summer working hours (8am – 3pm) from 15 May to 14 September. Good balance between working time and spare time.










 
                                Development opportunities and good scholarship scheme                            



Challenging work assignments contribute to good professional learning. Sharing knowledge in the daily work is an important factor for success. We have good arrangements for competence development, both in relation to project work and participation in courses and workshops. We also have a very good arrangement for scholarship where the employees can apply for financial support for post-qualifying education.










 
                                Development programme for young employees                            



BRUng is a skills development initiative for employees who are 35 years of age or younger, and who primarily have higher education. The programme will contribute to young employees becoming more visible as resources in the organisation, more confident in themselves and the competence resource they are to the Brønnøysund Register Centre.
The issues in BRUng are related to new technology, new forms of collaboration, innovation and new creation. Meetings are held where we alternate between lectures, discussions, panel debates, group work and work on specific issues through so-called sprints. The programme lasts approximately six months.










 
                                Exercising and activities                            



All employees have two hours a week that may be used for optional exercise during the working hours. In our premises in Brønnøysund, you have access to a free exercise room.
We have an active welfare committee that organises various activities during the year, including special arrangements for new employees. The regular activities of the corporate sports team are football, indoor bandy and swimming.










 
                                Help to find housing/relocation grant                            



If, as a new employee, you need to find housing, we can help with this.
In certain cases, we may also provide relocation grant.










 
                                Pension and insurance schemes and loan options                            



As an employee, you are a member of the Norwegian Public Service Pension Fund, which is one of the best pension schemes in Norway. There you will gain access to one of the marketing’s best dwelling loan. Through this pension fund, your insurance includes collective life and occupational injury insurance, as well.










 
                                Leave of absence                            



We have good schemes for care and welfare leave, paid and unpaid. It is possible to get leave for studies and further development.
