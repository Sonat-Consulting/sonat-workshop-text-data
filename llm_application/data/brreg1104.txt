Roles in a foreign business

Last updated: 6 June 2023.





Here you find an overview of the roles a foreign business must register with us. 

As a general rule, all persons who are registered with a role, must state a complete Norwegian national identity number or d-number.  The exception is the board and partners in the country of origin. Legal persons which have roles are to state the organisation number. Examples of legal persons are limited companies and partnerships.
The d-number is a separate number identifying foreign persons without a Norwegian national identity number.
When you apply for a d-number, you need to use a form that you attach to the Coordinated register notification. You will find it under Useful links on your right. In addition you need to enclose a certified copy of a valid proof of identity that contains a photo of the applicant, the applicant’s full name, date of birth, gender, expiry date and citizenship. You will find an overview of who can confirm the identification documents in the application form for d-number.

A Norwegian registered foreign business is to have a general manager, contact person or business manager. The business is not obliged to have a general manager, but if the business in Norway has a general manager, you must report this.
When you want to notify a general manager in the Register of Business Enterprises, you need to enclose 

documentation showing the appointment or engagement of the general manager

When you are going to register a contact person, you have to enclose

a confirmation showing the connection between the contact person and the business in the country of origin

The confirmation should be made by the foreign business. If a business  has been reported as the Norwegian representative and the contact person is employed by the representative, the representative may confirm the connection between the contact person and the foreign business.
There is no requirement for attachments to register a general manager or a business manager in the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities.
