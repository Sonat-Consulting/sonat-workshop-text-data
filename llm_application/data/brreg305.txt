The Shareholder Register

Last updated: 28 October 2021.





We do not have any information about company shareholders. 

If you have questions for the Shareholder Register, you must contact the Tax Administration. To obtain information about shareholders, you can also contact the company in question, as the company is obliged to keep its own updated shareholder register.
All private limited companies have to submit a shareholder register statement once a year. The Brønnøysund Register Centre does not keep any record of shareholders.
