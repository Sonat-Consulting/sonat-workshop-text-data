A joint ownership is not founded, but arises when two or more own something jointly.
When you are going to register a joint ownership, you must attach

documentation showing the existence of a co-ownership, such as a copy of a deed, an agreement or a will.

The documentation must contain information about what the co-ownership is, who are the co-owners, the ownership fraction and the liability of the co-owners.
See example of content in a co-ownership agreement (pdf) – in Norwegian
If the joint ownership is to have a board, you must also attach

association of articles, or agreement, showing that the co-ownership is to have a board, how this is to be elected and its authority
signed minutes from the ownership agreement showing the election of the board
