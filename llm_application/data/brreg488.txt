In the first step you notify the decision to dissolve the enterprise. When the creditor deadline of six weeks has expired, you may send a notification of final closing.
 







 
                                Dissolution                            



The decision of dissolution must be made by two consecutive general meetings with at least four weeksâ€™ intervals. One must be an ordinary general meeting.
The general meeting must also elect a liquidation board. The liquidation board replaces the board and the business manager. New board members must confirm that they have taken on the assignment.
You must enclose

minutes from both general meetings showing the decision of dissolution and election of the liquidation board.

After the creditor deadline of six weeks and the distribution has been terminated, the audited settlement must be presented to the general meeting. Once the settlement is approved, you can strike off the housing cooperative with us by submitting the form Coordinated register notification.

                                Revoking the dissolution                            



The general meeting may revoke the decision to dissolve, if at least half of the unit holders vote in favor, and the partition or payment to the unit holders has not taken place.
You must report the revocation to the Register of Business Enterprises quickly.
Upon revoking, the general meeting must also elect an ordinary board.
You must attach

minutes from the general meeting showing the decision to revoke the dissolution and election of the board

If new board members are elected to the the board, these must confirm that they have taken on the assignment. They do this by signing the notification.
If the housing cooperative is obliged to have a business manager, you must also register this, since the enterprise does not have this role during the dissolution.
