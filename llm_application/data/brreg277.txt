About the Register of Private Debt Amnesty

Last updated: 27 October 2021.





The Register of Private Debt AmnestyÂ contains information about persons who have been granted debt negotiations and debt settlement.

The Register of Private Debt Amnesty was established in 1991. It contains information about who has been granted debt negotiations, debt settlement, and has a copy of all signed debt settlement agreements. The register also contains information on what stage the proceedings are at, the enforcement commissioner or the court of enforcement and the prevailing deadlines.
Pursuant to the Debt Settlement Act, persons with serious debt problems shall be given a chance to gain control of their finances. A central registration of all agreements was a prerequisite for initiating the debt-settlement system.
The impact of the act and the register appears to be substantially stronger than the number of registrations would suggest. Everything points to the fact that creditors are more willing to find flexible solutions on their own rather than enter into a formalised, registered agreement which would entail heavier expenses.
The information that is available from the Register of Private Debt Amnesty is limited, and it is required that the person in question can be identified by using his/her national identity number. A copy of a debt settlement agreement can only be requisitioned by the public authorities or the parties concerned. After a debt settlement period has ended the registered information is only accessible to the execution and enforcement authorities.
