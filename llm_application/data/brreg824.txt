Technical documentation for machineable access to the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities

Last updated: 30 November 2022.





If you are going to retrieve data from the database of the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities, you must develop a code that can query our web services. 

What queries you can make, how the format of these must be and the URL to be linked up to, are described in the WSDLs below. The WDSLs are considered as a technical contract for how queries and results should appear, and must be followed in order to minimize the chance that upgrades with us may affect your service.
Web services’ reuse of basic data will be found as encoded transmission here:

Technical description
This service deviates slightly from the other services with regards to input. The parameters of this service are
• username
• password
• searchRequest
Username and password are similar to the other services, while searchRequest is to contain an xml-string, corresponding to <BrAixXmlRequest> in the XML form. What does not appear from the XML form is that in front of the element above, an encoding should be added that tells which character set is used: <?xml version=’1.0′ encoding=’xxx’?>. In other words, there must be correspondence between what is specified as a character set and what is actually in the xml string.
Examples
< ?xml version=’1.0′ encoding=’ISO-8859-1′?><BrAixXmlRequest>….</BrAixXmlRequest>
If encoding is set to ISO-8859-1, the text in the XML must have this character set< ?xml version=’1.0′ encoding=’UTF-8’?><BrAixXmlRequest>….</BrAixXmlRequest>
If the encoding is set to UTF-8, the text in the XML must have this character set.
If the <?XML version=’1.0′ encoding=’xxx’?> is omitted, the XML string will be interpreted by default as UTF-8.
If there is a discrepancy between encoding and what is actually in the XML string, you can get unexpected answers. This applies primarily to the use of æ, ø and å, but can also cause problems when searching for other special characters.
Example of a recommended searchrequest
<![CDATA[<?XML version = “1.0” encoding = “ISO-8859-1” standalone = “no” ?>
<BrAixXmlRequest RequestName=”BrErfrSok”>
<BrErfrSok>
<BrSokeStreng>ørn</BrSokeStreng>
<MaxTreffReturneres>1000</MaxTreffReturneres>
<ReturnerIngenHvisMax>true</ReturnerIngenHvisMax>
<RequestingIPAddr>010.001.052.011</RequestingIPAddr>
<RequestingService>SOAP</RequestingService>
<WithSubentities>true</WithSubentitiesr>
</BrErfrSok>
</BrAixXmlRequest>]]>
Description of the various elements is under annotation on each element in the XML form.

Information and case types in the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities
The Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities and the Register of Business Enterprises process daily notifications of initial registrations, changes and closures for between 2000 and 2500 enterprises. Once per month the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities receives updated information from the NAV Register Management about number of employees. This leads to changes for approximately 90.000 to 100.000 enterprises.
The individual user must define which enterprises (organisation number) and which information is to be monitored. If the enterprises and the information included in the daily update file are defined, the user can through Web Services retrieve the current information registered on the enterprise. The user can thus keep his own database updated at all times.

Role overview is a compilation of a person’s connection to business activity.
Role overview (XML)
You can obtain a role overview both on person (national ID number) and enterprise (organisation number). It is more rare that a role search for an organisation number yields hits. Please note that you will not receive a client overview for the accountant and auditor by searching for the organisation number of the accountant or the auditor.

                                Historical basic data                            



Contains historical information about all registered enterprises in the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities. It is divided into three services:

Historical overview of approved change cases and case disclosures about an enterprise.
Historical register transcript with the entire national ID number.
Historical register transcript with the birth date

The first service displays all registered case disclosures about a given subentity. We do not provide historical information about subentities. From the overview with case disclosures, the date will show when the changes have been registered. This date, along with the organisation number, is used as a search identifier to provide historical information presented in a register transcript.
Public agencies and actors who have a licence to conduct credit information service can gain access to the entire national ID number. Other actors can make inquiries in historical register transcript with the date of birth.
The service is built up with JAX-WS and makes use of WS-security in order to establish a secure connection between the client and the Web Service. The client must use SOAPHandler<SOAPMessageContext>, and implement methods this offers. In the handler class, a SOAPHeader must be built up with an element «UsernameToken». In that element, two elements «Username» and «Password» are added, which, respectively, contain the client’s username and password. The handler class must be declared in a SOA Handler XML file, and the service class annotated with @Handlerchain. The annotation must contain a file attribute that points to handler-chain xml.
In order to connect to the “Case disclosures” and “Historical information” services with Web Services, the connection is made to the following URL where WSDL file is located.
