The content of the memorandum of association
In the memorandum, you normally include information concerning which persons were present at the meeting, the time and the place of the meeting, the formal decision of establishing an association with a specific purpose for which the members wish to work, and the election of a board. The articles of the association must be approved in the meeting of incorporation. The memorandum of association must be signed.
See example of memorandum of association for clubs and associations (pdf) â€“ in Norwegian
Do you not have the memorandum of association?
If the association or the club is formed a long time ago, but has had no need to register until now, it may not be possible to find the original memorandum of association.
You can explain the situation in the form Coordinated register notification, and attach the minutes from the last annual meeting, which will verify that there is activity in the club or association.
