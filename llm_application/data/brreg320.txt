Notify a demerger
Coordinated register notification








You can report a triangular demerger if the acquiring company is part of a company group, and the shareholders of the acquired company receive shares in the parent company of the acquiring company or another group company instead of the acquiring company.
The demerger can follow the rules for demerger by capital reduction or a liquidation process.
You need to report a triangular demerger in a two-step process, containing decision and implementation.Â Once we have approved notifications about demergers, we will send feedback and a certificate of registration in the post.
 







 
                                Decision                            



You notify a decision to demerge for all the companies participating in the demerger. If you submit the information electronically through the Coordinated register notification, there is a common form for the acquired company and any existing acquiring company.
You have one month to notify the Register of Business Enterprises about this decision, as from the time when the participating companies approve the demerger plan. The one month period starts at the point of time when the last company approves the demerger plan.
If the notification is not sent to the Register of Business Enterprises within the deadline, the decision is annulled.
The acquired company must attach

minutes from the general meeting showing the approval of the demerger plan

After the decision is registered and the six week creditor time limit has passed, you can notify the implementation of the demerger.
